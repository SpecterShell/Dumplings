    New
    - Interoperability improvements for the CSS anchor positioning and Navigation web APIs.
    Fixed
    - Fixed a regression where position: sticky elements on some webpages could appear stuck or fail to update while mousewheel-scrolling after certain :hover interactions. (Bug 2010481)
    - Fixed an issue where the Firefox Developer Tools could fail to re-open after using the Inspector’s node picker and reloading a page containing cross-origin iframes. (Bug 2003810)
    - Fixed an issue where the DNS over HTTPS provider settings section could appear as a blank box, preventing users from seeing the current setting or changing it. (Bug 2010501)
    - Fixed an issue on Windows systems with a large number of fonts installed where parts of the Firefox UI (tabs, menus, and Settings) could display garbled characters or symbols instead of readable text. (Bug 2012950)
    - Reference link to 147.0.2 release notes.
    Unresolved
    - On Linux (Wayland) systems, certain popups and context menus will sometimes open in the wrong place, such as the top-left corner of the window. Firefox 147.0.3 has a partial mitigation for this problem and remaining instances will be addressed in a future release. (Bug 2003045)
