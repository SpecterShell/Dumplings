    SECURITY:
    - connect: Upgrade envoy version to 1.35.6 [GH-23056]
    - security: Updated golang.org/x/crypto from v0.42.0 to v0.44.0. This resolves GO-2025-4116
    IMPROVEMENTS:
    - ui: Removed ember-route-action-helper and migrated all {{route-action}} usages to explicit route/controller logic. [GH-23004]
    - ui: Replaced reopen() calls with direct property assignment and subclassing to resolve Ember component reopen deprecation warnings [GH-22971]
    - ui: removed deprecated Route#renderTemplate usage by introducing DebugLayout component and controller-based conditional rendering for docs routes [GH-22978]
    - ui: resolved multiple Ember deprecations:
    - Removed mutation-after-consumption warnings in Outlet by staging state updates outside the render pass
    - Replaced deprecated Route#replaceWith/transitionTo usage with RouterService in affected routes
    - Avoided mutating objects produced by {{hash}} (setting-on-hash) by switching to tracked POJOs [GH-23010]
    BUG FIXES:
    - acl: fixed a bug where ACL policy replication in WANfed is impacted when primaryDC is inconsistent [GH-22954]
    - xds: fix RBAC failure in upstream service when there are more than one downstream exported service with same name but different peer [GH-23049]
    - xds: fix bug where Using replacePrefixMatch: "/" results in double slashes (//path) and Using replacePrefixMatch: "" does not strip the prefix at all (e.g., mapping /v1/dashboard → /dashboard) resulting in 301 and 404 errors respectively [GH-23035]
