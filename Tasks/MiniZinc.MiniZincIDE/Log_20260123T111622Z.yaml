    Changes:
    - Automatically detect Gurobi 13.0 and potential future versions.
    - Enable projection of arrays of tuples and records using field access notation (issue 970).
    - Enable anonymous assignment generators in comprehensions.
    - Rewrite regular to fzn_regular instead of fzn_regular_set when possible, in order to improve performance for solvers that do not support fzn_regular_set natively (issue 981).
    - Add zip and unzip functions to the standard library (issue 967).
    - Add enum constructors lifted to arrays (issue 965).
    - Add sliding_among constraint to the standard globals library (issue 960).
    - Improve support for input of enum definitions using using JSON data files.
    Bug fixes:
    - Fix type checking for tuple and record literals to correctly reflect whether they contain any variable types (issue 955).
    - Fix bug in decomposition for the reified nvalue global (issue 964).
    - Fix issue where output items were evaluated twice when using JSON streaming output mode
    - Fix bug in type inference for arrays of tuples or records containing a mix of optional and non-optional arrays (issue 963).
    - Fix typing of indexed comprehensions that create arrays of arrays.
    - Fix output of arrays with optional elements in cases where the array definition cannot be moved to the output model.
    - Fix domain bounds when hoisting if-then-else expressions.
    - Fix bugs in the parser where a syntax error could lead to a crash because of incorrectly initialised memory.
    - Fix a bug in type checking of arrays of arrays that could result in crashes (issue 980).
    - Fix type checking of varified type aliases (issue 983).
    - Fix a flattening bug that introduced integer constants into float expressions, potentially leading to crashes (issue 984).
    - Fix crash when emitting solutions with empty sets for the gecode_presolver solver interface (issue 988).
    - Fix a bug in the flattening of output expressions that could result in the output model being invalid (issue 975).
    - Fix type checking of return types of generic functions that return tuples or records.
    - Fix type checking of functions that return arrays with generic index sets and enum element types.
    - Fix false-positive enum compatibility type errors when using enum2int in arguments to generic functions.
    - Improve performance of function matching by avoiding to copy functions unnecessarily between models.
    - Fix incorrect printing of anonymous enum values.
    - Fix typing of generic functions with integer array indices when called with enum indexed arrays (issue 966).
