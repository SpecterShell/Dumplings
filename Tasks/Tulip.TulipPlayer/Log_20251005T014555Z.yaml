    We're excited to announce the release of Tulip Desktop Player version 2.9.0.
    Version 2.9.0 of Desktop Player will be available for download by 9:00PM ET tomorrow (October 4th, 2025)! If you have auto updates enabled, the Desktop Player application will update in the background and changes will take effect the next time the application is restarted. Alternatively, you can manually initiate the update process from the file menu.
    Feature Enhancements
    - Adds Player support for a torque multi tool driver.
    - We now have retry logic for async snapshot and video recordings, and if it fails, we now save the file locally.
    - In Player, a warning will be shown if a user attempts to close Player while triggers are still executing.
    - On the TorqueOP, the torqueOP driver now allows you to select job numbers greater than 99.
    - For Edge Drivers, the Phidgets SDK is added for Edge Drivers. The cloud side changes will be added in the next few releases to allow users to use the driver/
    Bug Fixes
    - Fixed a bug for the image or video capture feature in Vision. Now, there are "snapshotUploadFailed" and "videoUploadFailed" events that will display a message if related events (e.g. Start image capture, Start image capture of a Region, Record a video clip, or Record a video clip of a Region) fail to upload the captured image or video.
    - Fixed an issue where the desktop player would navigate away from player app when clicking on hyperlinks in the document viewer. The links should now open on the default browser.
    - Fixes issue where custom edge drivers were not starting.
    End of Support for Mac Intel Processor
    - Player 2.9.0 will be the last release that will be supported for Mac Intel Processor. This change impacts less than .08% of all interfaces and users who are impacted will be notified. See the community post here
