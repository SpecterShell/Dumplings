    Improvements
    - Added that if you use the pressing enter on invalid input will "open text using a keyword" option (Settings &gt Misc), you can define a list of "starts-with text" that should never be text launched. Per default it contains "?", so in case you make a typo like ?sheep (instead of ?sleep) it will not launch this using a keyword. The setting is found in executor.ini and named launchignorelist. See hidden settings for more info.
    - Keyword commands that contains double quoted filepaths will now display the icon for that filepath instead of the default Executor icon.
    - The keyword editor filter search now supports empty text values using "". For example comment:"" will list all keywords with an empty comment field.
    - The icon: filter in the keyword editor, now supports "starts-with" using the icon filepath. So for example icon:c:\icons will show all matches where the icon is located in c:\icons
    - The installer now has better versioning information for package managers etc. (once new the installer has been installed).
