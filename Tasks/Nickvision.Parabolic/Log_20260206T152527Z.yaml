    This release contains a complete overhaul of the downloading engine as it was rewritten from C++ to C#. This will provide us with more stable performance and faster iteration of highly requested features (see the long list below!!). The UIs for both Windows and Linux were also ported to C# and got a face lift, providing a smoother and more beautiful downloading experience.
    Besides the rewrite, this release also contains many new features (including quality and subtitle options for playlists - finally!) and plenty of bug fixes with an updated yt-dlp.
    NOTE: This release drops snap packaging support for Parabolic on Linux.
    NOTE: This release drops portable packing support for Parabolic on Windows.
