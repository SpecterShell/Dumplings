    - core: make patch tool more reliable and consistent with other editing tools The patch tool now works seamlessly alongside other file editing tools with improved error handling and a more intuitive permission system. Users will experience: - More reliable patch application with better error messages - Consistent permission prompts that match other editing tools - Smoother integration when applying complex multi-file changes - Better feedback on what changes are being made before applying patches This refactoring leverages the robust patch parsing engine while making the tool feel native to the opencode workflow, reducing friction when making bulk changes to your codebase.
    - core: remove redundant patch integration test The integration test was duplicating coverage already provided by the comprehensive patch namespace tests. Users benefit from faster test runs without losing any coverage of patch functionality. The remaining tests provide complete validation of patch parsing, application, and tool integration.
