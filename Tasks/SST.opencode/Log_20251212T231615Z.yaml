    - Improved shell handling on Windows with better detection of Git Bash and support for the OPENCODE_GIT_BASH_PATH environment variable
    - Fixed app exit behavior so the app only exits when the prompt is empty; otherwise, the exit key will fall through to allow normal text input
    - Improved shell fallback compatibility by removing the -l flag when executing commands in unknown shells
