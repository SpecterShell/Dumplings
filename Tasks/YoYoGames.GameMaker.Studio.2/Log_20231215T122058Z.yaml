    2023.11 brings lots of behind-the-scenes performance improvements to both the IDE and Runtime; various new functions have been added to expand what you can do with buffers and rooms; following on from the SDF Effects added last release, you can now apply these effects to text tracks within your Sequences; you can now create your own Game Strip projects (and there is a new template you can use to learn about Game Strips); and there is a very large number of bug fixes and also some of the popular community requests since our public request system was revealed a few months ago.

    Changes To The Release Notes
    - TThe milestone pages linked already higher up this page show what is fixed or changed in this release (the "Closed" list on each page)
    - It also shows you what else is intended for the Monthly release and is yet to be fixed or implemented (the "Open" list on each page)
    - You can expand the "Show More" near the top of the page to read the overview/summarised information about what is in the release - including detailed information on all the GML language changes
    - Milestone pages will stay up-to-date during Beta periods as features are added and bugs are found, and so this is the new way of seeing all of the "Headline Known Issues" also
