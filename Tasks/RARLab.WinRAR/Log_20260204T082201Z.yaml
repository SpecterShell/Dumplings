    1. Original and packed file size column widths in "l" and "v" commands
         are increased by 1 symbol, so 10 digit file sizes are also displayed
         aligned by these commands.

      2. If "Reuse existing window" option is enabled when opening an archive,
         but another WinRAR copy is busy with archive processing, the archive
         is opened by current copy. Previously neither of copies opened it.

      3. Bugs fixed:

         a) previous beta failed to open archives in ZIP format with extra fields
            shorter than 4 bytes, such as some APK files;

         b) "Ask" option in WinRAR "Settings/Viewer/Viewer type" didn't display
            the viewer type prompt for PNG files and several other image formats;

         c) -ag switch 'k' modifier used English week day names even
            in localized versions.
