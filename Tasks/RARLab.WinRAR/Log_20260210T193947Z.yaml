    1. Performance improvements when deleting files in solid RAR archives:

         a) if there are no non-zero files after deleted files, archive
            recompressing isn't performed;

         b) part of archive before deleted files is copied as is, without
            repacking. Its contents is unpacked to memory if necessary,
            but not recompressed;

         c) semi-solid archive processing involves only solid blocks containing
            deleted files. Unaffected solid blocks are copied as is.

      2. "Generate archive name by mask" archiving option and -ag command line
          switch:

         a) new 'K' format character defines the current day of week
            name as a text string;

         b) new 'O' format character defines the current month name as a text
            string regardless of format character number. Unlike "MMM" mask,
            it allows to use shorter or longer than 3 character names,
            such as -agOO;

         c) excessive format characters exceeding the available field width
            are now ignored instead of appending to archive name.
            So it is possible to use full month or week day names by providing
            format characters in the amount equal or exceeding the longest name,
            such as -agKKKKKKKKKK for day of week names.

      3. Command line -s switch:

         a) switch -s accepts the optional parameter preceded by '=' character.

            Switches -s, -se, -sv, -sv-, -s- are replaced by -s=f, -s=e,
            -s=v, -s=d, -s=-. Previous versions of these switches are still
            supported in the current version, but can be removed in the future.

            It is allowed to combine multiple modifiers in the same switch,
            such as -s=e100f.

         b) new switch -s=r resets the solid statistics before adding new files
            to existing archive.

      4. Switch -tk now accepts the optional date parameter in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
         format. If used without parameter when modifying an archive,
         it preserves the original archive time. If optional parameter
         is present, it is assigned to archive modification time.

         It is allowed to insert separators like '-' or ':' to the date string
         and omit trailing fields. For example, switch -tk2025-06-01 is correct.

      5. "Specified time" is added to "Set archive time to" options on "Time"
         page of archiving dialog. It allows to assign the manually entered time
         to newly created or modified archives.

      6. UTF-8 output format and byte order mark options are added to
         "Generate report" command.

      7. "Cloud files" option is added to "Where to check for SFX archives"
         group in "Settings/Integration/Context menu items..." dialog.

         If this option is off, WinRAR shell extension will not attempt
         to detect if archive is self-extracting, when right clicking
         an executable cloud file not available locally. This detection
         involves data read and can be slow for such files.

         This option relies on file attributes returned by a cloud storage
         provider and can be ignored if required attribute isn't supported
         by specific cloud service.

      8. "Copy to clipboard" button at the bottom of "Search results" dialog
         places current results of "Find files" command to clipboard.

      9. It takes less time to open a large archive with a lot of files
         and folders in WinRAR file list. This is most noticeable for ZIP
         archives containing millions of files.

     10. Improved extraction speed of TAR and TAR based archives,
         such as .tar.gz or tar.xz. It is most visible for hard disk drives
         with slower seek time and large archives containing a lot of files.

     11. SFX module sets sfxnamenoext environment variable, containing
         SFX archive name without path and extension. It allows to append
         the archive name to user defined destination path like:

         Path=c:\Util\%sfxnamenoext%"

     12. "minsize" parameter, defining the minimum file reference size
         in -oi[0-4][:] switch, now can include an optional trailing
         unit size character. So -oi:1m is the equivalent of -oi:1048576.

     13. Switch -x recognizes exclude paths with both Windows and Unix style
         path separators, so -xfolder\file and -xfolder/file do the same.
         Previously only -xfolder\file excluded the file.

     14. Bugs fixed:

         a) "Files to exclude" field of archiving dialog was ignored for all
            but first ZIP archives if "Put each file to separate archive"
            option was turned on;

         b) when processing "Convert archives" command, "Use for all archives"
            option in the password prompt was available only for encrypted
            archives with file name encryption and couldn't be enabled
            when converting archives without encrypted file names.
