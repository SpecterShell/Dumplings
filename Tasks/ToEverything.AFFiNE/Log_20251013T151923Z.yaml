    1. Doc icon
    This is a feature long anticipated by our users, and the doc icon has now officially launched. You can now add various emojis to different documents, and also choose from our carefully curated icon collection, with support for multiple color options. We believe this feature will help users organize and manage their documents more efficiently.
    2. MCP
    To further enhance the collaborative efficiency between AFFiNE and other products in your workflow, we have launched the brand new MCP feature. You simply need to select MCP in the integration settings and copy the generated JSON code into tools like Cursor. This will enable Cursor to read the content of your AFFiNE workspace documents, thereby achieving efficient collaboration between documents and code.
    3. Claude Sonnet 4.5 / Gemini 2.5 Pro
    To enhance your AI experience, we have simultaneously updated the latest Claude and Gemini models. You can now select and use these new models from the model list.
    4. Insert AI block
    Now you can directly insert AI-generated blocks into the main text.
