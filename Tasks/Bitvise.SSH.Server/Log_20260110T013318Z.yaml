    - Control Panel and Settings:
      - Dark mode: If the Windows color mode is set to Light or Custom; and the Windows app mode is set to Light; then list view headers, scrollbars and system menus would appear with light backgrounds instead of dark. Fixed.
    - Logging:
      - It is possible to configure the SSH Server with a very long Penalty login attempt delay, for example if the purpose is to confuse clients that attempt to guess passwords. This would cause previous 9.5x versions to log warnings about stuck connections. This is now logged at Info-level only.
ReleaseTime: 2026-01-10
