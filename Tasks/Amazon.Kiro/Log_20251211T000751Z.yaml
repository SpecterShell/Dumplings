    Includes 0.7.34 patch.

    This release introduces Powers for dynamic MCP tool loading, conversation summarization to manage context windows, and slash commands for quick access to hooks and steering files.
    Powers
    Introducing Powers, a new way to give Kiro's agent instant expertise for any framework or tool. Powers package MCP servers, steering files, and hooks into reusable bundles that activate on-demand based on your conversation context. Instead of loading all MCP tools upfront and overwhelming your context window, powers load dynamically when you mention relevant keywords. Browse curated powers from launch partners including Datadog, Dynatrace, Figma, Neon, Netlify, Postman, Supabase, Stripe, and more—or create your own.
    Summarization
    Adds automatic conversation summarization to manage long conversations. When your conversation reaches 80% of the model's context window limit, Kiro automatically summarizes previous messages to bring context usage back below the limit. A new context usage meter in the chat panel shows what percentage of the model's context is being used.
    Slash commands
    Introducing slash commands for quick access to hooks and steering files directly from the chat input. Type / to see available commands and execute them instantly. Hooks with manual triggers and steering files configured with manual inclusion appear in the slash command menu, letting you run tests, sync documentation, or pull in specific guidance on demand.
