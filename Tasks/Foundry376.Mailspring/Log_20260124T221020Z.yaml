    Features:
    - Calendar now includes a Day View for more detailed scheduling. (#2573)
    - Calendar events can now be edited and synced back to the server. Drag events to reschedule them, or double-click to edit details. (#2574)
    - Mailspring now supports one-click unsubscribe using email headers (RFC 2369/8058). When an email includes unsubscribe headers, a link appears to quickly unsubscribe. (#2576)
    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed a race condition in category pickers (folder/label selectors) that caused the search input to lock up. (#2580)
    - Fixed composer input lag where Enter and Backspace keys sometimes required multiple presses. (#2578)
    - Fixed Office365 OAuth authentication issues caused by an origin header. (#2579)
    - Fixed RSVP calendar event handling bugs and improved RFC 5546/6047 compliance. (#2575)
    - Add missing mailsync dependencies to the Linux packages. We now dynamically link against curl, etc. and need these to be listed as Requirements.
    - Improve reliability of iCloud accounts by disabling QRESYNC, which is known to be incorrectly implemented by iCloud. Note: I /think/ this will fix the long-standing disappearing messages issue, at the expense of slightly slower sync of non-inbox folders.
    - Fixed network error handling during CardDAV/CalDAV discovery.
    - Fixed HTTP 406 errors during CardDAV/CalDAV discovery on Yahoo accounts.
    - Fixed in-reply-to header parsing on iCloud accounts where spam messages contain garbage values.
    - Fixed Yandex account sync error handling.
    Improvements:
    - Screenshot Mode now supports non-Latin characters. (#2577) Thanks @cheack!
    Developer:
    - Added GitHub Actions checks that verify Linux artifacts (.deb, .rpm) install and run correctly on Ubuntu 22/24, Fedora 40/41/43, and Arch Linux.
    - Removed unused Grunt tasks and cleaned up the eslint task. (#2569)
    - Windows mailsync dependencies moved to vcpkg for OpenSSL 3.6, latest libcurl, iconv, libtidy, libxml2, and sasl2.
    - Added openSUSE Tumbleweed to mailsync CI tests.
