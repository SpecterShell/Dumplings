    Bug Fixes:
    - Keyboard navigation in Mailspring's thread list has been fixed!
    - On Fedora, the libtidy dependency is more broadly specified to support both soname versions (libtidy.so.5 or libtidy.so.58)
    We're aware of issues with Wayland support for some Linux users and are investigating how to handle these scenarios better, since Wayland became the default for Electron apps in September.
