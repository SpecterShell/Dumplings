    Features:
    - Grammar check is now available in the composer! (#2612)
      - This feature relies on a deployment of LanguageTool at id.getmailspring.com - when you use Grammar Check, small snippets of your draft are sent to this server, but the requests are not logged and no message data is stored.
      - This feature is disabled by default. To turn it on, click the new icon in the composer toolbar.
    - Mailspring now properly detects "Do Not Disturb" status on MacOS Sequoia and on Windows.
    Bug Fixes:
    - On Wayland, the --background flag now shows the main window briefly then hides it, which is the best we can do under Wayland's rules. (#2623)
    - On Wayland, fixed a keyboard freeze in the composer caused by a double focus() call. (#2622)
    - Fixed sound notifications playing on Windows regardless of the notification preference. (#2619)
    - Fixed the tray icon theme detection on GNOME/Unity Linux desktops. (#2610)
    - Fixed a crash in vCard parsing when the VERSION line is not found.
    - Fixed an issue with the first CardDAV sync incorrectly seeing existing ETags in mailsync.
    - Fixed IMAP IDLE to process VANISHED notifications sent by FastMail (and possibly other providers).
    - Fixed folder priority logic that was incorrectly applied to non-iCloud accounts in mailsync.
    Improvements:
    - Added support for the stnadard biographies / notes field on contacts. (#2621)
    - Rearranged the thread context menu to reduce accidental destructive actions. (#2620)
    - Added an empty state to the calendar when no CalDAV accounts are connected. (#2625)
    - The draft window now uses the message subject as the window title.
    - Improved read receipt tracking pixel reliability. (#2613)
    - Improved mail rules robustness and fixed condition evaluation bugs. (#2616)
    - Added VTIMEZONE to created calendar events so they are created on Yahoo in the correct timezone.
    - Enabled CalDAV discovery to support Fastmail, Yahoo, and other providers in the upcoming calendar.
    - On Windows, the app icon is now a rounded square to better fit with Windows 11 design guidelines.
    Developer:
    - Replaced CSS-based platform hiding with React conditionals in preferences. (#2614)
    - Removed subpixel-antialiased font smoothing overrides. (#2618)
    - Added syncInit to main-calendar to eliminate a 2.5s startup delay. (#2606)
