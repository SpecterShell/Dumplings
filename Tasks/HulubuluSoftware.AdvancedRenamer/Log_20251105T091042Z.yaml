    Changes to metadata writer

    The user interface for the metadata batch writer has changed to better support large batches. The user interface is not more compact and performs better when many files are shown in the list.

    You can now also use tags when setting metadata values. This makes it possible to set metadata values based on other metadata values or file properties.

    Name collision rule improvements

    A new Name Collision rule has been added called Append Character. It works in the same way as Append Number, but instead of appending a number to make the filename unique, it will append characters (A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, etc), like the <Inc Alpha> tag.

    The Append Number rule now has a new option to start from a custom number instead of 1. To force a specific number length, append zeros, like this to get a 4 digit number: 0001.
