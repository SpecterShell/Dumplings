    Command search

    The program now has a command search feature, which can be opened with Ctrl+P (Windows) or âŒ˜P (Mac). It can be used to quickly find and execute commands in the program, like adding a specific method, opening settings, or adding files. Most features shown in toolbars and menus are available through the command search. Just start typing to filter the list of commands and press Enter to execute the selected command.

    Configure favorite folders

    A list of favorite folders can now be configured on the folder panel. Use it to quickly navigate to the folders you use the most. Right click a folder and click "Add to favorites" to add it to the list.

    Quick change UI settings

    Various parts of the UI can be customized to fit your liking. These configurations are available in the settings window, but to make it easier to change these settings, some of them are now available through a right click menu on selected UI elements in the main window.

    The Insert Tag and Pattern windows have been merged

    Instead of two separate windows for inserting tags and patterns, there is now only one window with all the functionality of both. This means that all windows that support tags also have the option to save the pattern for later use. Can also be used to store your favorite regex patterns.
