    Windows
    - gh-139810: Installing with py install 3[.x]-dev will now select final versions as well as prereleases.
    Tools/Demos
    - gh-141692: Each slice of an iOS XCframework now contains a lib folder that contains a symlink to the libpython dylib. This allows binary modules to be compiled for iOS using dynamic libreary linking, rather than Framework linking.
    - gh-141442: The iOS testbed now correctly handles test arguments that contain spaces.
    - gh-140702: The iOS testbed app will now expose the GITHUB_ACTIONS environment variable to iOS apps being tested.
    - gh-137484: Have Tools/wasm/wasi put the build Python into a directory named after the build triple instead of “build”.
    - gh-137248: Add a --logdir option to Tools/wasm/wasi for specifying where to write log files.
    - gh-137243: Have Tools/wasm/wasi detect a WASI SDK install in /opt when it was directly extracted from a release tarball.
    Tests
    - gh-140482: Preserve and restore the state of stty echo as part of the test environment.
    - gh-140082: Update python -m test to set FORCE_COLOR=1 when being run with color enabled so that unittest which is run by it with redirected output will output in color.
    - gh-139208: Fix regrtest --fast-ci --verbose: don’t ignore the --verbose option anymore. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-136442: Use exitcode 1 instead of 5 if unittest.TestCase.setUpClass() raises an exception
    Security
    - gh-139700: Check consistency of the zip64 end of central directory record. Support records with “zip64 extensible data” if there are no bytes prepended to the ZIP file.
    - gh-139283: sqlite3: correctly handle maximum number of rows to fetch in Cursor.fetchmany and reject negative values for Cursor.arraysize. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-137836: Add support of the “plaintext” element, RAWTEXT elements “xmp”, “iframe”, “noembed” and “noframes”, and optionally RAWTEXT element “noscript” in html.parser.HTMLParser.
    - gh-136063: email.message: ensure linear complexity for legacy HTTP parameters parsing. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
    - gh-136065: Fix quadratic complexity in os.path.expandvars().
    - gh-119451: Fix a potential memory denial of service in the http.client module. When connecting to a malicious server, it could cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated. This could have led to symptoms including a MemoryError, swapping, out of memory (OOM) killed processes or containers, or even system crashes.
    - gh-119342: Fix a potential memory denial of service in the plistlib module. When reading a Plist file received from untrusted source, it could cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated. This could have led to symptoms including a MemoryError, swapping, out of memory (OOM) killed processes or containers, or even system crashes.
    Library
    - gh-74389: When the stdin being used by a subprocess.Popen instance is closed, this is now ignored in subprocess.Popen.communicate() instead of leaving the class in an inconsistent state.
    - gh-87512: Fix subprocess.Popen.communicate() timeout handling on Windows when writing large input. Previously, the timeout was ignored during stdin writing, causing the method to block indefinitely if the child process did not consume input quickly. The stdin write is now performed in a background thread, allowing the timeout to be properly enforced.
    - gh-141473: When subprocess.Popen.communicate() was called with input and a timeout and is called for a second time after a TimeoutExpired exception before the process has died, it should no longer hang.
    - gh-59000: Fix pdb breakpoint resolution for class methods when the module defining the class is not imported.
    - gh-141570: Support file-like object raising OSError from fileno() in color detection (_colorize.can_colorize()). This can occur when sys.stdout is redirected.

    - gh-140938: The statistics.stdev() and statistics.pstdev() functions now raise a ValueError when the input contains an infinity or a NaN.
    - gh-124111: Updated Tcl threading configuration in _tkinter to assume that threads are always available in Tcl 9 and later.
    - gh-137109: The os.fork and related forking APIs will no longer warn in the common case where Linux or macOS platform APIs return the number of threads in a process and find the answer to be 1 even when a os.register_at_fork() after_in_parent= callback (re)starts a thread.

    - gh-140797: The undocumented re.Scanner class now forbids regular expressions containing capturing groups in its lexicon patterns. Patterns using capturing groups could previously lead to crashes with segmentation fault. Use non-capturing groups (?:…) instead.
    - gh-125115: Refactor the pdb parsing issue so positional arguments can pass through intuitively.
    - gh-140815: faulthandler now detects if a frame or a code object is invalid or freed. Patch by Victor Stinner.

    - gh-137400: Fix a crash in the free threading build when disabling profiling or tracing across all threads with PyEval_SetProfileAllThreads() or PyEval_SetTraceAllThreads() or their Python equivalents threading.settrace_all_threads() and threading.setprofile_all_threads().
    - gh-58124: Fix name of the Python encoding in Unicode errors of the code page codec: use “cp65000” and “cp65001” instead of “CP_UTF7” and “CP_UTF8” which are not valid Python code names. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-132657: Improve performance of frozenset by removing locks in the free-threading build.

    - gh-137422: Fix free threading race condition in PyImport_AddModuleRef(). It was previously possible for two calls to the function return two different objects, only one of which was stored in sys.modules.
    - gh-140042: Removed the sqlite3_shutdown call that could cause closing connections for sqlite when used with multiple sub interpreters.
    - gh-141042: Make qNaN in PyFloat_Pack2() and PyFloat_Pack4(), if while conversion to a narrower precision floating-point format — the remaining after truncation payload will be zero. Patch by Sergey B Kirpichev.
    - gh-140487: Fix Py_RETURN_NOTIMPLEMENTED in limited C API 3.11 and older: don’t treat Py_NotImplemented as immortal. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-140153: Fix Py_REFCNT() definition on limited C API 3.11-3.13. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-139653: Add PyUnstable_ThreadState_SetStackProtection() and PyUnstable_ThreadState_ResetStackProtection() functions to set the stack protection base address and stack protection size of a Python thread state. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    Build
    - gh-141808: Do not generate the jit stencils twice in case of PGO builds on Windows.
    - gh-141784: Fix _remote_debugging_module.c compilation on 32-bit Linux. Include Python.h before system headers to make sure that _remote_debugging_module.c uses the same types (ABI) than Python. Patch by Victor Stinner.
    - gh-140768: Warn when the WASI SDK version doesn’t match what’s supported.
    - gh-140513: Generate a clear compilation error when _Py_TAIL_CALL_INTERP is enabled but either preserve_none or musttail is not supported.
    - gh-140189: iOS builds were added to CI.
    - gh-138489: When cross-compiling for WASI by build_wasm or build_emscripten, the build-details.json step is now included in the build process, just like with native builds.
      This fixes the libinstall task which requires the build-details.json file during the process.
    - gh-137618: PYTHON_FOR_REGEN now requires Python 3.10 to Python 3.15. Patch by Adam Turner.
    - gh-123681: Check the strftime() behavior at runtime instead of at the compile time to support cross-compiling. Remove the internal macro _Py_NORMALIZE_CENTURY.
