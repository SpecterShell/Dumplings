    🐛 Bug Fixes
    Fixed: TUI/Web UI showing incorrect total file size
    - Issue: Total download size would start at 8GB, then jump to 35GB, then 214GB during download
    - Cause: plan_item events were emitted incrementally during download loop, not upfront
    - Fix: All plan_item events are now emitted immediately after scanning, before downloads start
    Fixed: Settings not taking effect in Web UI
    - Issue: Changing settings (connections, max-active, retries, etc.) had no effect on downloads
    - Cause: Settings were hardcoded in multiple places; serve command was missing flags
    - Fix:
      - Added MultipartThreshold, Verify, Retries fields to server Config
      - Added --multipart-threshold, --verify, --retries flags to serve command
      - Web UI now fetches settings from server on page load (authoritative source)
    Fixed: Plan API missing Excludes and Endpoint
    - Issue: Preview/plan requests didn't respect exclude patterns or custom endpoint
    - Fix: Added Excludes, AppendFilterSubdir to job and Endpoint to settings in plan handler
