    New features and improvements:
    A new set of paint-on features designed to give you more flexibility and control when preparing your prints:
    Paint seams directly on your model to define where Cura places the z-seam, or block areas where seams should not appear. Paint extruder assignments for multi-material printing. Easily designate different regions of your model to different extruders with a simple brush workflow. These new painting tools make it easier than ever to fine-tune the look, feel, and performance of your parts.
    Try it for yourself with this Painting Easel Test.

    UltiMakerâ€™s newest professional printers the UltiMaker S6 and UltiMaker S8 get even more powerful . Expanded print core support: slice with AA 0.25, AA 0.4, AA 0.8, CC 0.4, and CC 0.6 cores. Improved material quality: PLA, Tough PLA, ABS, and PETG profiles now produce smoother surfaces, stronger parts, and better dimensional accuracy. New draft intent profiles: faster printing options for common materials, optimized for productivity. Visit our website if you want to learn which of our S Series 3D printers is right for you.
    If you were not using the USB-Cable Printing in the previous (5.10) version of Cura, it is automatically disabled for them. In addition, an option is added to the Cura Preferences under General where user can easily Enable or Disable the USB-cable printing by checking, unchecking the setting and restarting Cura.
    - Introduced a pop-up that appears if user have an extruder that they are not using, allowing them to disable it for better quality
    - Updated the Release Notification so the team can share more information about what's in the new release.
    - Updated the logic for storing Cura Back-ups to download instead of store Cura plugins when restoring a back-up.
    - Updated the Splash Screen and Header to show the correct UltiMaker logo.
    - Updated local connection to UltiMaker Printers to allow for user verification.
    - If users were not using the USB-Cable Printing in the previous (5.10) version of Cura, it is automatically disabled for them. In addition, an option is added to the Cura Preferences under General where user can easily Enable or Disable the USB-cable printing by checking, unchecking the setting and restarting Cura.
    - Significantly updated the ChangeAtZ Script, to support relative extrusion, firmware retraction. Added "layer range" as an option and Travel moves are separated so changes in print speed don't necessarily affect them, contributed by @GregValiant
    - Introduced a Post Processing Script that allows user to use their printer for Annealing or Drying, contributed by @GregValiant
    - Updated the DisplayInfoOnLCD plug-in so it now correctly displays the Remaining time, contributed by @GregValiant, resolves https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/18766
    - Update Create Thumbnail Post Processing Plugin with an option Thumbnail Begin/End and Use '*' for size of image, contributed by @geekykayaker-anon
    - Updated the Cooling Profile Post Processing Plug-in to include Build Volume Fan, and Idle Speed, contributed by @GregValiant
    - Updated the Filament Change Post Processing Log-in to hide the "Z-Move" when in "use firmware configuration" mode, contributed by @GregValiant
    - Enable more retraction settings to be set per-model, contributed by @jeremysalwen
    - Updated Insert At Layerchange post processing plug-in to allow for lowercase commands, resolves https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/20441
    - Introduced a Post Processing Script that allows for defining Z-Hop on Travel, contributed by @GregValiant
    New Settings:
    - Multi-material Precision, and Multi-material Depth allow you to finetune your painted brush strokes
    - Initial layer build fan speed, and build fan speed settings for more control over the build volume fan
    - Retraction During Travel Move, Keep Retracting During Travel, and Prime During Travel Move allow you to tune the retractions during a travel move, to allow for more effective traveling. NOTE: If the printer has pressure advance or a filament flow sensor, please keep an eye on the print
    - Initial Layer Build Fan Speed, and Build Fan Speed Settings for more control over the build volume fan
    - Top Surface Expansion for expanding top surfaces so they can be concealed by the layers above, resulting in a better visual quality, particularly for models with curved surfaces or fine details.
    Bugs resolved since the Beta release:
    - Improved slicing time on Windows machines making it significantly faster for a number of models
    - Updated traveling directions for monotonic top surface, to reduce traveling and improve part quality
    - Fixed a bug where painting closed shapes would not respect the drawn lines but would close filled shapes
    - Introduced a workaround for deprecated face selection methods to remain backwards compatible for plugins
    - Multi material settings are now settable per mesh
    - Fixed a bug where you had to reslice to see your preview again after saving or sending the model
    - Fixed group handling for painting features, and disabled painting for grouped objects because the painting is currently designed to allow painting a single object at once
    - Fixed a bug where Cura would crash if you switched to another printer with a painted model
    - Fixed a bug where the model and a prime tower could collide when a model was painted
    - Fixed a bug where you could slice with a painted disabled extruder
    - Improved handling of rotating your view when you are in paint on mode
    - Updated settings to improve overhang, top/bottom settings on the UltiMaker S6 and S8
    - Updated settings to improve the Z seam settings for Factor 4
