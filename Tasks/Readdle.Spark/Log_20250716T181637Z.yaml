    We’ve improved sync stability for Spark for Teams by fixing a rare case where shared content such as comments and threads, might not sync correctly without restarting the app.
    More improvements:
    - Improved AI Summary language handling for translated emails.
    - Added editing and rich formatting options for Meeting Notes.
