    We’ve redesigned the email layout and shipped several notable improvements across navigation, scheduling, and file sharing.
    New additions:
    - Share meeting notes as emails via a dedicated button above each note.
    - Find shared availability faster by pasting a list of addresses into Meet With.
    - Fetch new messages on demand using the Check New Email button in the sidebar.
    - See previously viewed emails in a dedicated Recently Seen folder.
    - Control avatars and preview lines in Settings > Appearance.
    Improvements:
    - Emails and cards use a new layout for faster navigation.
    - Split View now shows clearer separation between the email list and viewer.
    - Mark as Done and Close buttons have more space between them to prevent misclicks.
    - Active account names are clearly visible when viewing a specific account.
    - Unread Cards now follow the account order from the sidebar.
    - Recent search queries can be cleared by hovering and clicking X.
    - Snooze, Send Later, and Reminders now support custom times.
