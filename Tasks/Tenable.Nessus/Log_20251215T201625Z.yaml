    Changed Functionality and Performance Enhancements

    The following changes are included in Tenable Nessus 10.11.1:
    - Tenable Nessus Manager Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Plugin Optimization — Added support for Tenable Nessus Manager to generate plugin databases for RHEL-derived distributions. This update will allow agents 11.1.0 and later to retrieve only the plugins specific to their Linux distribution.
      Note: Tenable Nessus Manager now produces plugin databases for pre-11.1.0 and post-11.1.0 agents, which requires additional storage space and time for processing plugins. For more information, see the Tenable Nessus Manager Hardware Requirements.
    Security Updates
    The following are security updates included in Tenable Nessus 10.11.1:
    - Updated libxml2 to version 2.13.9.
    - Updated libxslt to version 1.1.45.
    - Updated expat to version 2.7.3.
      For more information, see the Tenable Product Security Advisory.

    Upgrade Notes
    - Tenable Vulnerability Management FedRAMP environments support Tenable Nessus scanners versions 10.4.0 and later.
    - If you are connecting to Tenable Vulnerability Management through Tenable Nessus scanners, Tenable Agents, Tenable Web App Scanning scanners, or Tenable Network Monitors (NNM) located in mainland China, you must connect through sensor.cloud.tenablecloud.cn instead of sensor.cloud.tenable.com.
    - You can upgrade to the latest version of Tenable Nessus from any previously supported version.
    - If your upgrade path skips versions of Tenable Nessus, Tenable recommends reviewing the release notes for all skipped versions to learn about new features and bug fixes.
    - If you want your scanners to update to the newest version before the GA date automatically, set your Tenable Nessus Update Plan to Opt in to Early Access releases.
    - If you want to update your scanners to the latest version before the GA date manually, disable automatic updates so the scanner does not automatically downgrade to the previous version.
