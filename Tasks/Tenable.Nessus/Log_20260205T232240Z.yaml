    Upgrade Notes
    - Tenable Vulnerability Management FedRAMP environments support Tenable Nessus scanners versions 10.4.0 and later.
    - If you are connecting to Tenable Vulnerability Management through Tenable Nessus scanners, Tenable Agents, Tenable Web App Scanning scanners, or Tenable Network Monitors (NNM) located in mainland China, you must connect through sensor.cloud.tenablecloud.cn instead of sensor.cloud.tenable.com.
    - You can upgrade to the latest version of Tenable Nessus from any previously supported version.
    - If your upgrade path skips versions of Tenable Nessus, Tenable recommends reviewing the release notes for all skipped versions to learn about new features and bug fixes.
    - If you want your scanners to update to the newest version before the GA date automatically, set your Tenable Nessus Update Plan to Opt in to Early Access releases.
    - If you want to update your scanners to the latest version before the GA date manually, disable automatic updates so the scanner does not automatically downgrade to the previous version.
