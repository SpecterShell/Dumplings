    Kubernetes support for Relay Service

    Other changes and improvements
    - Updated Go to 1.24.11. #61953
    - Added support for discovering EC2 instances in all regions, without enumerating them. Requires access to account.ListRegions in the IAM Role assumed by the Discovery Service. #61924
    - Fixed a bug where JWT-SVID timestamp claims would be represented using scientific notation. #61921
    - Fixed "SSH cert not found" errors in Teleport Connect. #61846
    - Added support for authenticating Azure resource discovery using Azure OIDC integrations. #61830
    - Fixed a bug in Proxy recording mode where Teleport Node sessions would result in duplicate audit events with a different session ID. #61246
    - Tuned teleport-cluster, teleport-kube-agent, and teleport-relay Helm charts to reduce the probability of Teleport exceeding its memory limits and being OOM-Killed. GOMEMLIMIT defaults to 90% of the configured memory limits.
    Enterprise:
    - Added support for AWS Account name and ID labels (teleport.dev/account-id, teleport.dev/account-name) on AWS Identity Center resources (aws_ic_account_assignment and aws_ic_account). These labels improve compatibility with Access Monitoring Rules, allowing users to more easily target and audit AWS IC accounts.
    - Updated the Access Automation Rules dialog to display rules in a paginated view.
