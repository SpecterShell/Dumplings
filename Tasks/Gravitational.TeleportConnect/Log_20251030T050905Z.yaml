    Web UI Workload ID
    Teleport's Web UI now lists all workload identity resources registered in the cluster.
    Relay Service
    Teleport now includes a new relay service that acts as a lightweight proxy service. This new service can receive connections from both SSH clients and agents.
    The relay service can be used to avoid routing SSH connections through the broader Teleport control plane, providing the ability to optimize network flows in large or complex deployments.
    Multi-cluster Discovery
    Multiple Teleport clusters can now discover the same EC2 instances simultaneously through auto-discovery, with each cluster operating independently without interference.
    Kubernetes Health Checks
    Teleport now continuously monitors the health of your registered Kubernetes clusters and displays their status directly in the web UI. When connecting to Kubernetes clusters, Teleport automatically routes you to healthy services, ensuring reliable access to your infrastructure.
    ElastiCache Serverless
    Teleport Database Access now supports connecting to ElastiCache Serverless databases.
    Other fixes and improvements

    - Create and edit GitLab join tokens from the Web UI. #60649
