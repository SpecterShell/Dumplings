    A new EAP build for CLion 2025.3 is ready for you to download! Here are the key updates:
    - We’ve streamlined the project configuration process for developers working with the nRF Connect SDK. Now, CLion accepts sysbuild as the default build configuration for these projects, so you can build, run, and debug them without having to configure additional West settings.
    - We’ve improved CLion Nova’s responsiveness in remote sessions, making typing assistance even smoother. Now, when you press Enter, the auto-indentation works as quickly as it does locally. This improvement to remote development is in addition to those introduced in v2025.2, which aim to move essential editor features from the IDE backend to the frontend.
    - The Serial Port Monitor plugin is now bundled in CLion, so you won’t need to install it manually. We’ve also improved the tool’s UI, including adding a more detailed description of devices in the port connection list to help you easily distinguish between them.
    Please try this build, share your feedback, and report any issues to our issue tracker.
