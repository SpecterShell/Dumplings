    CLion 2025.3 Beta is now available, featuring numerous updates and improvements introduced during the Early Access Program. Here are the most important ones:
    - We’ve implemented a constexpr debugger, which allows you to debug constexpr evaluations, including consteval functions, in the same way as with a regular debugger. You can perform basic debugging actions, such as stepping through the code or observing the evaluation stack, and use other features available during standard runtime debugging. Read our blog post to learn more.
    - We’ve added support for the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), which brings CLion closer to becoming a debugger-agnostic IDE. You can provide a path to your debugger with DAP support in Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | DAP Debuggers. Learn more about the feature in this blog post.
    - The Serial Port Monitor plugin is now bundled in CLion, so you won’t need to install it manually. We’ve also improved the tool’s UI, including adding a more detailed description of devices in the port connection list to help you easily distinguish between them.
    - CLion now supports the Visual Studio 2026 Insiders toolchain for Windows. This early-access version of Visual Studio 2026 provides the new MSVC build tools v14.50, including v19.50 of the C++ compiler. This compiler version supports new language features in C++23, including the auto(x) and auto{x} syntax that allows you to create a decayed prvalue or, to put it simply, to copy an object to a temporary (P0849R8). The compiler has also received several important bug fixes.
    - We’ve streamlined the project configuration process for developers working with the nRF Connect SDK. Now, CLion accepts sysbuild as the default build configuration for these projects, so you can build, run, and debug them without having to configure additional West settings.
    Please try this build, share your feedback, and report any issues to our issue tracker.
