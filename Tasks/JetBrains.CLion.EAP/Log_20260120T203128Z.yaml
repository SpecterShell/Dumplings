    The Early Access Program (EAP) for CLion 2026.1 has officially launched, and the first EAP build is here!
    Here are some of the key updates and improvements:
    - Debugging in remote development is now much more responsive and stable, thanks to a reworked debugger architecture. The debugger tool window and breakpoints are now rendered on the IDE frontend, while the backend hosts the active debugger session and communicates with the target process. Please note that there are still some issues that we are working on.
    - CLion Nova now extends deducing this support to assignment operators and defaulted comparison operators when explicit object parameters are used (CWG 2586, CPP-42767).
    - With ClangFormat enabled, committing code formatting changes now works as expected.
    - CLion Nova now provides limited support for code completion, syntax highlighting, code formatting, and other editor features for projects without run/debug configurations, where the project context is unavailable.
    Please try this build, share your feedback, and report any issues to issue tracker.
