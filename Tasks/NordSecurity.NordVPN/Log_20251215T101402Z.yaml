    * You asked, we listened. You can now set your preferred location for the “Secure my connection” button. The default is “Fastest server” but you can change this setting to any country or server group instead. Once you do, the app will stick to that choice every time you click the button.
    * Meet our brand-new AI-assisted recommendations for the fastest connection. Instead of relying on distance only, the smart selection considers several factors to pick the best server for your network conditions. Just choose “Fastest server” in the preferred location settings, and we’ll take it from there.

The new email protection feature in Threat Protection Pro™ now scans URLs in your browser’s Gmail and Yahoo inboxes and flags the unsafe ones. To learn what the threat is, just hover over the warning icon that appears next to a link.
