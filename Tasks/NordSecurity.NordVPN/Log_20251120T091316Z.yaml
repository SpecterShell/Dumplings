    * The app will from now on try (and try again if need be) to restore your VPN connection if it ever drops for any reason. In doing so, it’ll keep leak protection active so your data stays safe even mid-connection.
    * Our “Products” tab is growing up fast. The new “Your security suite” section shows what’s already protecting you — and what still needs a quick setup or just a click to turn it on. We’re not saying you should turn everything on… just that your security looks really good when you do.
