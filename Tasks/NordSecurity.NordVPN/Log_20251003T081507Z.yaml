    Threat Protection Pro™ has a new tool to keep you safer online:
    * “Hijacked session alert” will let you know if your website login cookies show up in a stolen sessions database. It’s already on if your plan includes Threat Protection Pro™, keeping unwelcome guests out of your accounts.
    VPN picked up a couple of handy updates:
    * The “Pause” button got more time options — 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes, or even 24 hours. Short break, long break, we’ve got all options covered.
    * “Quick Connect” is now called “Secure my connection.” It’s the same one-click path to the best server, minus the name that may have left you wondering if “Slow Connect” was hiding somewhere.
