    Highlights
    - Added a full OpenCode-aligned state architecture scaffold (Platform, Server, GlobalSDK, GlobalSync, Sync, Local providers) and a persisted storage helper.
    - Wired the new provider stack through AppEntry to prepare for future state migrations.
    - Refreshed the OpenWork logo and tightened UI/UX polish in the dashboard + sidebar flows.
    Improvements
    - New state entrypoints under src/app/state for sessions, templates, system, demo, and extensions.
    - Centralized platform abstractions (restart, notifications, storage) and server URL handling.
    - Global event pipeline with coalescing for high-frequency updates.
    Fixes
    - Restored CSS entry import and removed legacy MCP advanced props.
    - Prevented onboarding from reappearing for returning users.
    Notes
    This release is primarily architectural prep work and UI polish. No user-facing flows were removed.
