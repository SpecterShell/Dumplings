    Highlights
    - Fix a composer regression where long prompts could be overwritten by stale draft echoes, making typed text appear to disappear.
    Fixes & polish
    - Harden draft echo tracking in the session composer with bounded, time-windowed retention instead of a tiny fixed queue.
    - Added a Chrome MCP verification screenshot for long-input behavior in packages/app/pr/screenshots/composer-long-input-no-disappear.png.
    Packaging / ops
    - Bumped app, desktop, orchestrator, server, and router versions to 0.11.100.
