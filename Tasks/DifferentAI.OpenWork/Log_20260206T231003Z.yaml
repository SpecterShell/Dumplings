    Highlights
    - Multi-workspace hosting: OpenWork server now exposes all configured workspaces (GET /workspaces) and supports mounted workspace URLs (/w/:id) calling existing /workspace/:id/* routes safely.
    - Workspace-scoped Tasks sidebar: tasks stay visible across all workspaces (collapsed groups + counts), and "New task" reliably creates the task in the selected workspace.
    - Sharing: local Share prefers a stable workspace URL (.../w/<id>) by resolving the workspace id from the host.
    Chat Access (Owpenbot)
    - Multi-workspace routing via persisted bindings (channel, peerId) -> directory.
    - New /dir <path> command to bind a chat to a directory.
    - Health endpoints for binding management: GET /bindings, POST /bindings.
    Desktop
    - Default local engine runtime is now Openwrk (orchestrator).
