    Host mode now works on machines without OpenCode installed by correctly resolving the bundled OpenCode sidecar from the app executable directory.
    Changes in this release:
    - Fix: Resolve bundled opencode sidecar from the app binary directory (macOS Contents/MacOS/opencode) instead of only searching Contents/Resources.
    - Tests: Add Rust unit tests to prevent regressions in sidecar path resolution.
    - CI: Run the Rust tests in GitHub Actions as part of the desktop build workflow.
    If you still see "OpenCode CLI not found", restart OpenWork after updating.
