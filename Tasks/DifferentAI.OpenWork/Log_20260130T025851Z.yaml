    Send files through WhatsApp, enjoy a cleaner context panel, and experience less friction when reloading pages.

    Improved Context Panel — The context panel is now clearer and easier to scan, helping you understand what OpenWork sees at a glance. (#319)
    Smoother Reloads — Reload toast details now persist so you don't lose context, and Notion page reloads are less disruptive. (#318, #322)
