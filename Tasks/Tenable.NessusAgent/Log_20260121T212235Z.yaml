    Bug Fix Defect ID
    Reduced agent disk usage, particularly during plugin updates. This included:
    - Removed the creation and use of the plugin-attributes database.
    - Introduced a process to ensure that the agent does not attempt plugin installs if it detects there is not enough disk space on the filesystem.
    - Changed to the plugin database update and maintenance processes so that it uses less temporary disk space.
