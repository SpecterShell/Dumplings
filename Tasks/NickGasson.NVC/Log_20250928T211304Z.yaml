    The main focus of this release has been improving support Verilog and mixed-language simulation and some non-trivial designs can now be simulated, for example axis2mm from ZipCPU. Additionally:
    - Scheduling of blocking and non-blocking assignments in mixed-language simulation now more accurately reflects Verilog semantics (#1227).
    - Aliases of component declarations are now allowed (#1276).
    - Added missing check that partial associations appear in a contiguous sequence (#1254).
    - The new -I analysis option adds search directories for the Verilog include directive.
    - Fixed compatibility with LLVM 21.
    - Fixed a crash when --cover-file is specified with a non-existent directory (#1287).
    - The -f analysis option can now interpolate environment variables in the file list using $var.
    - Constraints for variables and signals declared with partially constrained subtypes are now correctly propagated from the initial
      value (#1274).
    - VHDL-2002 changes for buffer port connections are now implemented correctly (#1290).
    - The --precompile elaboration option is deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Please get in touch if you are still
      using this.
    - Passing array out arguments using the non-standard VHPIDIRECT calling convention now works correctly (#1301).
    - Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1253, #1269, #1277, #1279, #1280, #1281).
