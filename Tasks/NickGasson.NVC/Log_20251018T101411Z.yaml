    This is a minor bug fix release with the following changes:
    - Fixed a crash when compiling with AVX2 enabled (#1311).
    - Calling vhpi_get(vhpiBaseType, ..) on a subtype with additional constraints such as natural range 0 to 1 now correctly returns the vhpiIntTypeDeclK base type instead of another vhpiSubtypeDeclK.
    - Fixed a crash when release is used with a record signal (#1313).
    - Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1308, #1317, #1318, #1323).
