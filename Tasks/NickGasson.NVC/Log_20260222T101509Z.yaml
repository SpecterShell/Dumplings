    This is a minor bug fix release with the following changes:
    - Fixed a crash when dumping a waveform --dump-arrays and the design contains a null array of records (#1420).
    - Fixed an error when setting generics on the command line with -g after analysing with --preserve-case (#1421).
    - Added support for reading physical types in vhpi_get_value.
    - Fixed quoting issues which caused nvc --install to fail if the installation directory contained spaces (#1419).
    - Several other minor bugs were resolved (#1422, #1424).
