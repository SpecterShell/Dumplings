    Game development
    Rider now provides cloud-powered multi-line code completion for shaders in Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot projects. For Godot developers, cloud completion suggestions are also available for GDScript files.
    Working with databases
    Rider replaces the term query console with query file – because consoles have essentially always been files, and it's time the UI reflected that. We've also simplified the workflow, making it more discoverable and consistent. You can learn more about the change in this post.
    Learn more about these updates from our blog post.
    This update also brings a number of bug-fixes and stability improvements, including a fix for excessive memory usage when opening large solutions [RIDER-132952]. For the complete list of resolved issues, please refer to our issue tracker.
