    Rider 2025.3.2 is out with the following changes:
    Agent Client Protocol (ACP) agent registry support
    You can now browse and install ACP-compatible AI agents directly from a curated registry in the AI Chat tool window. ACP defines a standard protocol for AI coding agents, letting Rider connect to any compatible agent without custom integrations. Users can add agents from the registry and use them immediately in AI Chat.
    More information in this blog post.
