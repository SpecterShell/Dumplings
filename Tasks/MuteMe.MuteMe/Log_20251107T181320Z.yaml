    We're pleased to announce the release of MuteMe version 0.25.8 the biggest update yet with several new features and critical fixes. This release introduces the all-new Mute/Unmute Status Bar, powerful Not-In-Meeting Actions, and expanded keyboard shortcut support for all devices. We have also added support for Zoom breakout rooms! We’ve also improved compatibility with macOS Tahoe, optimized MuteSync lighting, and made microphone detection on Windows faster and more reliable. This is a huge release with tons of changes and improvements. See below for details.
    #376 – Feature: Mute/Unmute Status Bar
    We’ve added a optional persistent on-screen status bar so you can instantly see whether you’re muted or live no more second-guessing even if your MuteMe is not with you. This feature is part of MuteMe+
    #375 – Feature: Not In Meeting Features
    Now your MuteMe can do more than ever, even when you’re not in a call. You can trigger actions like opening a webpage, launching the emoji keyboard, muting speakers, or even taking a screenshot. This turns your MuteMe into an all-purpose productivity button that adapts to your workflow even when you are not in a meeting.

    This feature is part of MuteMe+
    #373 – Fixed: Electron / Chromium Bug for macOS Tahoe
    We resolved a major compatibility issue caused by Apple’s new Tahoe architecture. This update brings full updated Electron framework support to ensure smooth operation on all newer macOS versions. Learn more here regarding this issue and fix.
    #372 – Feature: Toggle on Press
    A highly requested update by our legacy users, MuteMe now supports toggling on press rather than only on release. You can choose whichever behavior feels more natural in your settings. This is great for our legacy device users that have earlier devices and multiple users had requested this feature.
    #370 – Fixed: MuteSync Lighting Effects
    We’ve fixed an issue that caused inconsistent lighting effects on MuteSync devices. Colors and patterns now match perfectly with your mute state for a more polished, reliable experience.
    #379 – Improved: Tray / Menu Bar Menu
    Improved the menu bar / tray icon menu so users can open settings directly, and mute / unmute from the menu also.
    #369 – Fixed: Excessive Location Requests on Windows 11
    We eliminated repeated location and firewall permission prompts that were appearing on Windows systems. The app now binds only to localhost, improving privacy and reducing unnecessary notifications. This problem was also made worse by a bug in the electron framework which has since been patched up.
    #368 – Fixed: Memory Leak in WebEx (macOS)
    We’ve addressed a major memory leak that affected WebEx users on macOS. This fix ensures better resource management overall.
    #360 – Fixed: Google Meet Multiple Tabs Error
    If you had multiple Meet tabs open, the Chrome extension could get confused about which meeting was active. That’s now fixed, MuteMe keeps the right meeting in sync no matter how many tabs you juggle.
    #358 – Improved: Windows Microphone Detection
    We’ve enhanced microphone detection across all Windows systems, including better handling of connect/disconnect events and smarter recognition of mic-in-use states.
    #336 – Feature: Hotkey to Simulate Button Press
    Prefer the keyboard? You can now use global hotkeys to simulate your MuteMe button press. It’s perfect for users who like keeping their hands on the keys while staying in full control of their mic. This is also a highly requested feature that users were asking for. This feature is part of MuteMe+
    #8 – Feature: Support for Breakout Rooms Zoom
    This has been one of the longest standing items for our development team. This is issue number #8 and has been a issue since we started. MuteMe would not sync with zoom once you entered a breakout room. Support for breakout rooms has now been added. Testing is required to make sure it works well but we are ready to release this feature.
    #378 – Fixed: Embedded YouTube Videos
    At the end of October 2025 users indicated that the embedded videos in our application like when you first run the app, do not work anymore. Once we looked into this issue, we realized that YouTube had made some changes with respect to how embedded videos are treated and changed requirements which broke the integration. We made a change and embedded them into the application directly.

    #378 – Fixed: MuteMe Mini Generic Controller Bug
    0.25.7 had a bug in one of the device controllers which prevented some MuteMe Mini devices from connecting properly. This is now been resolved with version 0.25.8.
ReleaseTime: 2025-11-07
