    Today we're releasing Krita 5.2.14. This is going to be the last bug fix release for 5.2. This release in particular contains many bug and usability fixes for Android.
    Touch-and-Hold Color Picker
    The color picker has been improved to make it look, feel and function better. The most important change is for touchscreens: you can now press the screen with one finger and hold it in the same spot to bring up the color picker. This is enabled by default in all input profiles. If it doesn't happen for you, either reset your canvas input settings to the defaults or manually assign the One Finger Hold gesture like this:

    New Color Picker Preview
    Aside from that, the preview has also been changed from the rectangles side by side to a circle around the cursor. This gives better visibility to the colors you are picking and also means that your right hand won't obscure the preview if you're drawing on a screen tablet. If you don't like the way this looks, you can change the appearance of the circle in the settings or go back to a two-rectangles style preview instead. Except now you can choose whether you want them on the right like before, on the left or on top of the cursor. Additionally, the long-standing issue of the preview getting rotated and mirrored along with the canvas has been fixed. It will now show up in the same spot no matter how you spin it.

    Changelog:
    Beyond that, we have a ton of smaller usability fixes for touch, a new icon on MacOS and much more.
    Special thanks to Freya Lupen, Stuffins, Joshua Goins in addition to the sponsored developers.
