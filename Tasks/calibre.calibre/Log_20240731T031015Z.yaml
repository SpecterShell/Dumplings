    Bug fixes
    - ONLY if you use the calibre Content server, you should update calibre as soon as possible
      Closes tickets: 2075128
      If you do not know what the Content server is, you do not use it, and these do not apply to you. If you have set a password to access the Content server that you have not shared with anyone, these do not affect you. A remote code execution bug in the Content server introduced in calibre version 6.9.0 (released on 2022-11-25) means that anyone with access to the server also has access to the rest of the computer the server is running on. If you are using a password to protect access to the server only people that know the password can gain access via the bug. Thanks to STAR Labs (https://starlabs.sg) for finding these vulnerabilities.
