    What's New:

    AMD GPU Support + More

    Our internal Ollama provider was bumped to the latest version (0.3.14) which includes support for AMD GPUs, as well as other improvements.
    For Windows, we install the additional support files during the installation process automatically. For MacOS, there is nothing to do.
    Import any Ollama Model Tag or Hugging Face Model

    You can now import any Ollama model tag or Hugging Face model into AnythingLLM using the default Ollama provider. Simply enter the tag or URL and hit import. This allows you to use models that are not explicitly listed in the UI.
    Just paste in the ollama run command and hit import!
    Pulling from Ollama.com (opens in a new tab) example: ollama run mistral-nemo
    Pulling from Hugging Face (opens in a new tab) example: ollama run hf.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF
    Computer Use (Anthropic AI)

    AnythingLLM can now leverage the new Anthropic AI Computer Use models.
    This is an experimental feature (opens in a new tab) and must be explicitly enabled in your system settings.
    Find-in-page support for workspace chat

    You can now find specific text within the workspace chat window. Simply press Ctrl+F to open the finder input at the top-right of the chat window.
