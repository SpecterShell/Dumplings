    Fixed an error when the settings for old NMEA GPS models were still present in the registry.
    Fixed an error when exporting extremely large SVG files.
    Fixed namespace declarations in exported SVG.
    Deferred checking the printer settings until actually printing - this removes a delay at startup that some users were seeing with networked printers.
    Fixed the Temperature display in the Edit Waypoint dialog when Celcius was selected.
    Added Mass Storage Mode option for Garmin GPS 73.
    Removed .zip option on Import. Unzip your files first, and then import.
