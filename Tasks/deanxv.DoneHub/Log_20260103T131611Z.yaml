  Value: "Here's another update — This round squashes some small issues and adds a rate multiplier to payment gateways so you can customize top‑up ratios per gateway. Might seem niche, but if you're juggling third‑party payments and points platforms like LinuxDoCredit, you’ll appreciate the flexibility. Also fixed Epay callbacks (still puzzling why one‑hub and new‑api handle them so differently…) and cleaned up time‑zone quirks in stats. Take it or leave it — but if it breaks, that’s on you \U0001F609"
