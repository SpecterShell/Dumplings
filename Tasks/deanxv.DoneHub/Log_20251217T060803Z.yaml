  Value: "Long time no see — missed y'all! This release finally pushes a bunch of small features into a stable version, while also quietly fixing a few \"big\" little bugs. Gotta admit, the original Claude cache billing had a serious double‑charge bug (thanks, upstream dev…), so anyone using this project was probably paying extra (lol). Also tweaked some escaping compatibility. Oh, and you'll notice the model pricing page now shows units in \"M\" by default and only displays available models — you might not like it, but you're gonna accept her, 'cause I do. Oh right, also optimized the retry logic for Gemini channels: if a Gemini channel hits its daily limit, the <model‑channel> pair will auto‑freeze until 4 PM next day, Beijing time."
