  Value: "This version is absolutely stacked — right after our last big feature, we're rolling out another game-changer: Codex reverse proxy! If you've got an OpenAI Team subscription, you can now proxy it into a full API while keeping the original project's load-balancing goodness. And that’s not even the headline — we also merged upstream (shoutout to the OG devs!) and now your created tokens can restrict access by IP. Oh, and I squashed a few caching bugs too. Enough reading — go test it and let the \"NB!\" comments fly!"
