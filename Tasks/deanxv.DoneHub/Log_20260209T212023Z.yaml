  Value: Heh, been a while indeed — happy early New Year! This update patches a handful of minor issues, including fixes for the Antigravity channel and retry logic in certain Codex call scenarios (thanks @xxxxuanran). Also sorted out a parameter override bug in custom configs (cheers @mengtina), and tried to smooth out some streaming response quirks. Nothing major, just polish really — but if I go too long without a release, you might forget I exist. Then again, we're all bound to be forgotten someday, right? Catch you after the holiday!
