    This update fixes the fallback mechanism in the token configuration's backup group. And don't ask me why there was a bug in the first place — because I wasn't the one who wrote that feature! Honestly, you should be thanking me for fixing it.
    Besides, I bet you didn't even know the token config supported such a powerful yet easily overlooked feature like the backup group. Go try it out now — and learn to pay attention to the details.
