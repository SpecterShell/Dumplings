  Value: This is a heavyweight update — just merged code with the one-hub project again (takes hours every time since the two repos are totally independent, not even forked from each other…). Fixed a few of their untested new features while at it, rolled out multi‑user token stats, fully refactored the model pricing module, patched their backup token group bug, and optimized channel sorting cache. Fair warning — this touches a ton of code, so hidden bugs may be lurking. If you spot anything off, report it fast! And remember, your stars are what keep me pushing — don't stop!
