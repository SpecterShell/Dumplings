    Changes since Git for Windows v2.52.0 (November 17th 2025)
    New Features
    - Comes with Git v2.53.0.
    - Pressing the Tab key in an empty line in Git Bash no longer causes the session to "freeze".
    - Git for Windows' installer is now built by InnoSetup v6.6.1.
    - Comes with cURL v8.18.0.
    - Microsoft Edit can now be specified as Git editor.
    - Comes with Git Credential Manager v2.7.0, the "anniversary release" after one release-less year, which brings native x64 and ARM64 binaries for the respective flavors of Git for Windows.
    - Upgrades the memory allocator mimalloc that is used by Git for Windows to v2.2.7.
    - Comes with the MSYS2 runtime (Git for Windows flavor) based on Cygwin v3.6.6.
    - Comes with OpenSSL v3.5.5.
    Bug Fixes
    - The installer of Git for Windows v2.52 showed clipped text in some setups, which was fixed.
    - When calling Microsoft Store apps, their standard I/O is now set up correctly (meaning: You can call an interactive Python interpreter without the winpty hack mentioned in the release notes' Known Issues).
    - The astextplain tool (which is used by Git for Windows to generate diffs of .pdf and .doc files) used to handle empty files gracefully. This behavior is now reinstated.
