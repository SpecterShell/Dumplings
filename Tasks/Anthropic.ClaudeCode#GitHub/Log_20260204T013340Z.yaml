  Value: |-
    - Added session resume hint on exit, showing how to continue your conversation later
    - Added support for full-width (zenkaku) space input from Japanese IME in checkbox selection
    - Fixed PDF too large errors permanently locking up sessions, requiring users to start a new conversation
    - Fixed bash commands incorrectly reporting failure with "Read-only file system" errors when sandbox mode was enabled
    - Fixed a crash that made sessions unusable after entering plan mode when project config in ~/.claude.json was missing default fields
    - Fixed temperatureOverride being silently ignored in the streaming API path, causing all streaming requests to use the default temperature (1) regardless of the configured override
    - Fixed LSP shutdown/exit compatibility with strict language servers that reject null params
    - Improved system prompts to more clearly guide the model toward using dedicated tools (Read, Edit, Glob, Grep) instead of bash equivalents (cat, sed, grep, find), reducing unnecessary bash command usage
    - Improved PDF and request size error messages to show actual limits (100 pages, 20MB)
    - Reduced layout jitter in the terminal when the spinner appears and disappears during streaming
    - Removed misleading Anthropic API pricing from model selector for third-party provider (Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry) users
