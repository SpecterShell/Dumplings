    - Merged slash commands and skills, simplifying the mental model with no change in behavior
    - Added release channel (stable or latest) toggle to /config
    - Added detection and warnings for unreachable permission rules, with warnings in /doctor and after saving rules that include the source of each rule and actionable fix guidance
    - Fixed plan files persisting across /clear commands, now ensuring a fresh plan file is used after clearing a conversation
    - Fixed false skill duplicate detection on filesystems with large inodes (e.g., ExFAT) by using 64-bit precision for inode values
    - Fixed mismatch between background task count in status bar and items shown in tasks dialog
    - Fixed sub-agents using the wrong model during conversation compaction
    - Fixed web search in sub-agents using incorrect model
    - Fixed trust dialog acceptance when running from the home directory not enabling trust-requiring features like hooks during the session
    - Improved terminal rendering stability by preventing uncontrolled writes from corrupting cursor state
    - Improved slash command suggestion readability by truncating long descriptions to 2 lines
    - Changed tool hook execution timeout from 60 seconds to 10 minutes
    - [VSCode] Added clickable destination selector for permission requests, allowing you to choose where settings are saved (this project, all projects, shared with team, or session only)
