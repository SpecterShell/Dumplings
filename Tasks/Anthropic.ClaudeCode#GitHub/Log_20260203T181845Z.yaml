    - Added pages parameter to the Read tool for PDFs, allowing specific page ranges to be read (e.g., pages: "1-5"). Large PDFs (>10 pages) now return a lightweight reference when @ mentioned instead of being inlined into context.
    - Added pre-configured OAuth client credentials for MCP servers that don't support Dynamic Client Registration (e.g., Slack). Use --client-id and --client-secret with claude mcp add.
    - Added /debug for Claude to help troubleshoot the current session
    - Added support for additional git log and git show flags in read-only mode (e.g., --topo-order, --cherry-pick, --format, --raw)
    - Added token count, tool uses, and duration metrics to Task tool results
    - Added reduced motion mode to the config
    - Fixed phantom "(no content)" text blocks appearing in API conversation history, reducing token waste and potential model confusion
    - Fixed prompt cache not correctly invalidating when tool descriptions or input schemas changed, only when tool names changed
    - Fixed 400 errors that could occur after running /login when the conversation contained thinking blocks
    - Fixed a hang when resuming sessions with corrupted transcript files containing parentUuid cycles
    - Fixed rate limit message showing incorrect "/upgrade" suggestion for Max 20x users when extra-usage is unavailable
    - Fixed permission dialogs stealing focus while actively typing
    - Fixed subagents not being able to access SDK-provided MCP tools because they were not synced to the shared application state
    - Fixed a regression where Windows users with a .bashrc file could not run bash commands
    - Improved memory usage for --resume (68% reduction for users with many sessions) by replacing the session index with lightweight stat-based loading and progressive enrichment
    - Improved TaskStop tool to display the stopped command/task description in the result line instead of a generic "Task stopped" message
    - Changed /model to execute immediately instead of being queued
    - [VSCode] Added multiline input support to the "Other" text input in question dialogs (use Shift+Enter for new lines)
    - [VSCode] Fixed duplicate sessions appearing in the session list when starting a new conversation
