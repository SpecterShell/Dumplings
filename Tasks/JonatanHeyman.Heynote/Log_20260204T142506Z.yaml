    What's Changed
    Images
    Heynote now supports inline images. You can paste images from the clipboard or drag and drop image files.
    Images can be selected and resized directly in the editor, and it's quick and easy to put an image back
    on the system clipboard.

    Drawing on images
    Heynote now includes a lightweight drawing tool for adding quick, freehand annotations on top of images.

    - Fix issue not being able to record the Enter key when creating custom key bindings
