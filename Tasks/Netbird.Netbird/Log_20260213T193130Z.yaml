    Release Notes for v0.65.0
    What's New
    🔀 Reverse Proxy
    NetBird now includes a built-in reverse proxy in the management server, enabling proxied access to backend services through your NetBird network. Allowing you to expose your services to the public with the option to secure them with SSO, PINs, or passwords.
    No VPN client required for end users. Just point a custom domain at your NetBird server, configure the proxy in the dashboard, and your internal services are securely accessible from any browser. Think of it as a self-hosted alternative to Cloudflare Tunnels, but without the MITM and fully under your control.
    Key features:
    - Custom domains - Map your own domains to internal services and let NetBird handle TLS and routing via CNAME verification
    - Built-in authentication - Protect exposed services with SSO (via your configured IdP), PIN codes, passwords, or magic links directly from the dashboard
    - Multiple targets - Route traffic to one or more backend peers or resources with optional path-based routing
    - Access logs - Monitor who's accessing your proxied services with built-in logging
    - Proxy settings - Fine-tune behavior with options like host header passthrough and redirect rewriting
    Add a Service
    Expose any internal service by selecting a subdomain and adding one or more backend targets. Each target points to a peer or resource on your network.
    Custom Domains
    Bring your own domain by adding a CNAME record pointing to your NetBird proxy cluster. NetBird handles TLS certificate provisioning automatically.
    Authentication
    Secure your exposed services with multiple authentication methods. Enable one or combine several for layered protection.
    Settings
    Fine-tune proxy behavior with options like passing the original Host header to your backend or rewriting redirect URLs to use the public domain.
