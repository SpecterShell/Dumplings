    What's New
    🚨 Security Fix
    Security: Fixed account impersonation validation in management API
    Fixed a vulnerability in the management server's authentication middleware where the ?account= query parameter could be used to impersonate arbitrary accounts without proper validation when getting a list of accessible peers. It requires the attacker to have prior knowledge of the target accounts' and peer IDs.
    The fix adds explicit validation via IsValidChildAccount() before allowing account switching. Account impersonation is now only permitted when the target account is confirmed as a legitimate child account of the
    requesting user's parent account.
    Affected component: Management server HTTP middleware (auth_middleware.go) and /api/peers/<peer_id>/accessible-peers endpoint
    Severity: High — an authenticated user could potentially access or act on behalf of accounts they should not have access to by passing an arbitrary account parameter and fetching the list of accessible peers.
    Recommendation: All self-hosted deployments should upgrade to this version.
