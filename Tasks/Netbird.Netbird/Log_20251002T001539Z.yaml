    What's New
    Browser Client for Remote SSH & RDP Access
    We‚Äôre excited to introduce the NetBird Browser Client ‚Äì a secure, zero-install way to access your peers directly from your web browser.
    Highlights
    - No installation required ‚Äì connect from Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.
    - SSH & RDP support ‚Äì access Linux and Windows machines with full protocol support.
    - Runs in your browser ‚Äì a complete NetBird peer compiled to WebAssembly.
    - End-to-end encrypted ‚Äì secured with WireGuard¬Æ.
    - Temporary, secure access ‚Äì short-lived peers and ACLs are created automatically and cleaned up when the session ends.
    How it works
    Open your NetBird dashboard ‚Üí Peers view, choose a machine, and click Launch Console (SSH) or Remote Desktop (RDP).
    Your session runs securely in the browser with no software download needed.
