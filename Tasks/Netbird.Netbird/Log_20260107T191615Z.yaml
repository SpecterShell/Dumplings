    What's New
    🔓 Simplified Identity Provider Management
    Self-hosted NetBird no longer requires an external identity provider by default. Local users now work out of the box without any IdP dependency.
    What's changed:
    - No IdP required - Create and manage users directly from the Dashboard
    - Multiple IdP support - Configure Pocket ID, Auth0, Google, Microsoft, Okta, or any OIDC provider directly from the Dashboard
    - New quickstart script - Simpler deployment with fewer containers
    export NETBIRD_DOMAIN=netbird.example.com
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/releases/latest/download/getting-started.sh | bash
    This is available for new installations and is fully backward-compatible—existing setups will continue to work without changes. The previous Zitadel quickstart script remains available.
