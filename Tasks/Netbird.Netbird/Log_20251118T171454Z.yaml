    What's New
    Native SSH Access & OpenSSH Integration
    NetBird v0.60.0 ships a complete rewrite of SSH access. Every peer can now run a built-in SSH server, giving you identity-aware, private SSH access over your NetBird network — using either the netbird ssh command or your existing OpenSSH clients.
    Highlights
    - Built-in SSH server on every peer - Enable with netbird up --allow-server-ssh and get a native SSH endpoint without exposing port 22 to the internet.
    - Identity-aware access with JWT - SSH sessions are authenticated via your IdP (OIDC/JWT) by default, so you know which user accessed which machine.
    - Works with netbird ssh and OpenSSH - Use netbird ssh user@<peer-ip> or standard ssh, sftp, and scp commands; NetBird configures OpenSSH automatically via a drop-in 99-netbird.conf.
    - Port 22, transparently secured - NetBird listens on TCP 22022 and redirects NetBird-network port 22 traffic to it, so existing SSH workflows keep working without changing ports.
    - Advanced features when you need them - Optional SFTP, local and remote port forwarding, root login, and JWT token caching (--ssh-jwt-cache-ttl) for fewer auth prompts.
    - Machine identity mode (legacy behavior) - Prefer host-based trust? Disable JWT auth with --disable-ssh-auth and rely purely on network-level ACLs.
    How it works
    1. Enable the SSH server on the target peer
    netbird down  # if already running
    netbird up --allow-server-ssh
    Add optional flags for SFTP, port forwarding, or root login as needed:
    netbird up --allow-server-ssh \
      --enable-ssh-local-port-forwarding \
      --enable-ssh-remote-port-forwarding \
      --enable-ssh-sftp \
      --enable-ssh-root
    2. Create an ACL policy for SSH
       Allow TCP port 22022 from your SSH client peers/groups to your SSH server peers/groups in Access Control.
    3. Enable SSH in the Dashboard
       Open the target peer → enable SSH Access.
    4. Connect via CLI or OpenSSH
    - NetBird CLI:
    netbird ssh user@100.119.230.104
    - OpenSSH:
    ssh user@100.119.230.104
    sftp user@100.119.230.104
    scp file.txt user@100.119.230.104:/path

    Client Improvements
    - Updated the client login success page with an improved user experience.
      #4797
    - Reverted deprecated gRPC client code migration to restore expected behavior.
      #4805

    Management Improvements
    - Fixed handling of port ranges in route firewall rules to ensure accurate rule application.
      #4801

    Upgrade & Compatibility Notes
    - ⚠️ NetBird SSH in v0.60.0 is a breaking change:
      - Server port changed from 44338 → 22022
      - Authentication moved from machine public keys to JWT-based user identity
      - Implicit firewall rules were removed - you now need an explicit ACL for port 22022
    - ⚠️ Version compatibility: v0.60.0+ SSH is not backward compatible with older peers.
      For self-hosted environments, we recommend updating in this order:
      1. Management server
      2. Dashboard (for browser SSH, if used)
      3. SSH servers first (peers with --allow-server-ssh)
      4. SSH clients last (netbird ssh users)
