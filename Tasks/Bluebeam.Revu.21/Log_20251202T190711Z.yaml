    Revu 21.8 - Release Notes
    What’s New
    - Round Corners – Round one or more corners for Polygon and Polyline markups.
    - Studio Project Search now includes markup results per file which link directly to their location.
    - Delete a whole word when editing text markups in Revu by pressing Ctrl+Backspace.
    Task Link
    Task Link is an integration between Bluebeam Revu and GoCanvas that empowers office users to dispatch tasks to field teams and access real-time field updates within Revu. It requires a paid Bluebeam and GoCanvas Lite subscription or above. It is available for all global regions. GoCanvas supports only US-EN language.
    - Drop a markup on the drawing, assign a GoCanvas mobile form, and send it straight to your field team.
    - Your field team will get notified to complete the form in the GoCanvas app with everything they need—task details, reference Revu PDF drawings, and a due date.
    - The completed form shows up in Revu, linked right to the markup, so your office team always has the latest updates from the field.
    What’s Fixed
    - When placing an Area Measurement that has a highlighted fill, it appears opaque and blocks the view of the document when trying to place the Markup.
    - Issue with some Vitrium locked files not opening in Revu.
    - When opening a PDF that is an Outlook attachment, the screen is blank on ARM64 computers.
    - Polygonal Area measurements disappear at certain angles during placement.
    - Output folder in Stapler wizard always reverts back to Custom Folder and default system save path.
    - Clicking a link in a file continually launches new web tabs.
    - When printing from AutoCAD to the Bluebeam PDF Printer, the page is rotated 90 degrees.
    - Some links open within a web tab instead of being opened as a PDF file.
    - Cannot copy under Properties, Project Path links in Projects or Original Location in Studio Sessions.
    - Files containing JavaScript to submit Form do not work.
    - Additional improvements and fixes.
