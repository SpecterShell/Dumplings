  Key: ReleaseNotes
  Value: |-
    FIX: drag and drop from other applications did not work in some cases (since v3.32). (#70532)
    FIX: added workaround for issue introduced by Windows Update where increasing the file size (e.g., when adding cover art) gave an error 380 for files on file systems backed by cloud storage (e.g., OneDrive or Dropbox). (#70522, #70497, #70490, #70510, #70516)
    CHG: adding cover art using 'Manage covers...' now opens the same folder as adding cover art via the Tag Panel context menu.
    CHG: changed resizing behaviour of min. size mode when adjusting covers to target the requested size.
    FIX: cover thumbnails in list of Tag Sources query results were not displayed in some cases.
    NEW: added support for horizontal scrolling in File List via Shift + mouse wheel.

    NEW: added option to skip resizing when adjusting album covers.
    NEW: added support to resize to minimum size when adjusting album covers.
    CHG: PNG transparency is now converted to white instead of black when changing format to JPEG at adjusting album covers.
    FIX: regression where previous compatibility adjustment of writing covers of type Artist, Media, and Icon for MP4 via Nero tags was no longer used.
    FIX: writing MP4 tags to specific fragmented/streaming MP4 files is no longer refused.
    FIX: writing MP4 tags to specific fragmented/streaming MP4 files corrupted the file and now simply refuses to tag the file.
    CHG: auto-completion of custom values when editing in File List and Extended Tags is now only enabled if custom values exist for the field. (#70251)
    CHG: function `json_select_array` of Web Sources Framework now supports JSON arrays as unnamed root element. (#70274)
    FIX: ID3v2 frames with a different text encoding than the one requested to be written were not modified with the previous development build. (#70283)

    FIX: bitrate for MP3 files was reported incorrectly for very short tracks of less than 1 second duration. (#70271)
    CHG: writing ID3v2 tags preserves the original ID3v2 frames that were not modified.
    CHG: writing ID3v2 tags allows for writing multiple non-standard `WXXX` frames with the same description.
    CHG: writing WMA tags stores multiple values for fields that don't support multiple values as `Value 1; Value 2`.
    FIX: folders were automatically created if a format string is entered at 'Convert > Tag - Tag' for `_FILENAME` which contained directory separators `\`. (#70199)
    FIX: prevent server busy dialog from appearing during drag and drop when system dialogs (replace file, permissions) were shown (since v3.31h). (#70194)
    FIX: restored drag and drop for apps supporting link operations only. (since v3.32a). (#70144)
    NEW: added support for reading cover art from deprecated field `COVERART` in Ogg Vorbis files; rewriting now converts it to the recommended `METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE`. (#70180)

    FIX: output variables beginning with underscore were silently ignored at Web Sources Framework functions `SayFormat` and `UseFormat`. (#70122/23)
    CHG: limited drag and drop from File List to moving and copying files again. (#70144)
    CHG: determining available space required for a write operation to perform now resolves any reparse points of the given path.
