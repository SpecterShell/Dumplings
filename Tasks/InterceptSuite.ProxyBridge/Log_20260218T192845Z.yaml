    ProxyBridge v3.2.0 introduces major improvements across all platforms, highlighted by the first stable Linux release.

    🚀 Major
    - Linux Support
      ProxyBridge now fully supports Linux with its first stable Linux version.

    ✨ New Features

    - Rule Priority Management (#60)
      Windows users can now reorder proxy rules via drag-and-drop to set rule priority.
    - Multiple Rule Deletion (#60)
      Windows now supports deleting multiple proxy rules at once.
    - Localhost Proxy Support (#70)
      Windows now allows proxying localhost traffic using a new localhost proxy flag and configuration.
    - Platform-Specific Update Checker
      The update checker now validates updates specific to the running platform.
    - Process Name Support on macOS (#68)
      macOS now logs and applies proxy rules using the process name alongside the bundle identifier.
    - macOS Optimizations
      - Reduced memory usage
      - Fixed network speed degradation
      - Improved packet handling up to 2.5 Gbps

    🛠 Bug Fixes
    - IPv6 Packet Handling Fix (#62)
      Fixed an issue where IPv6 packets were dropped on Windows.
      IPv6 proxying is still not supported, but IPv6 packets now pass through directly without being dropped.
    - GUI Cleanup (#71)
      Removed unwanted example entries from the interface.
    - macOS Rule Evaluation Fix (#68)
      Fixed an issue where macOS evaluated only the first rule and ignored subsequent rules.

      Windows and macOS now fully support IP ranges in proxy rules.
