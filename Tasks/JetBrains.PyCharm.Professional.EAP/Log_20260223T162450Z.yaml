    Focused improvements to type system precision, smarter inspections, async correctness checks, and UI refinements. Highlights:
    Type Checking & Code Insight
    - Type system improvements: Added general support for type variance handling, improving correctness and consistency when working with generic types (PY-87075).
    - New inspections:
      - PyCharm now reports cases where a function returns None but its return value is used, helping prevent subtle runtime issues and improving code clarity (PY-80351).
      - Added a warning for non-awaited async function calls used in a boolean context, helping catch async bugs where a coroutine object is evaluated instead of awaited (PY-87568).
    UI Improvements
    - Python Process Output tool window: Introduced visual updates to the tree section of the Python Process Output tool window for improved readability and clearer structure (PY-87123).
