    - New connection pool architecture for efficient resource management
    - Reduced connection establishment overhead
    - Better performance under high concurrency
    Enhanced CLI Experience
    - New --address/-a and --server/-s flags for flexible configuration
    - Auto-load server address from config file
    - Improved terminal UI with centered tunnel URL display
    - Better daemon startup information feedback
    🔧 Improvements

    - Simplified proxy handler logic
    - Reorganized shared utilities (stats, ui, netutil)
    - Added CountingConn for traffic statistics
    - New pipe utilities for bidirectional data transfer
    🗑️ Removed
    - Deprecated HPACK compression module
    - Legacy binary header protocol
    - Custom flow control frame handling
    - Old frame handler implementation (~4800 lines of legacy code removed)
