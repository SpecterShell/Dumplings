    Highlights
    This release focuses on performance optimization and concurrency safety improvements, significantly enhancing throughput and stability under high-load scenarios.
    ⚠️ Breaking Changes
    - Removed manual GC tuning configuration in main.go, replaced with automatic tuning mode
    ✨ New Features
    Connection Pool Optimization
    - Implemented connection pool preheating to eliminate cold start delay
    - Optimized pool scaling logic with burst load batch expansion support
    - Concurrent data session creation to accelerate scaling
    - Added ping loop keep-alive mechanism for each session
    - Introduced GetSessionStats method for detailed session statistics
    Tunnel Management & Security
    - Implemented IP-based tunnel count and registration rate limits
    - Added rate limiter to prevent malicious registration behavior
    - Client IP address tracking for access control
    Concurrency Safety Enhancement
    - CAS loop implementation for atomic operations on global tunnel counter
    - Added rollback mechanism to ensure proper resource release on registration failure
    - Combined atomic operations with locks for thread-safe IP rate limiting
    ⚡ Performance Improvements
    Core Performance
    - Optimized session selection using min-heap, reducing time complexity from O(n) to O(log n)
    - Added bufio.Reader pool and buffer pool to reduce memory allocation
    - Implemented sharded lock manager for improved high-concurrency performance
    - Updated yamux with unified optimized configuration for better throughput
    - Added patterned GC tuning
    HTTP Server
    - Used sync.Pool to reuse bufio.Writer, reducing GC pressure
    - Enabled TCP_NODELAY for improved response speed
    - Adjusted HTTP server timeout configuration to balance performance and security
    Resource Management
    - Optimized stream open timeout control using context to prevent goroutine leaks
    - Improved shutdown process to ensure proper cleanup coroutine exit
    - Reduced maximum frame size from 10MB to 1MB to mitigate DoS risk
    - Used stack arrays instead of heap allocation for frame header reading
    🔧 Other Changes
    - ID generator now exclusively uses crypto/rand, removed timestamp fallback
    - Added TryGenerateID for non-panic error handling
    - Upgraded test scripts from Python to Go implementation
    - Added nginx WebSocket proxy header configuration documentation
    Upgrade Guide
    This release primarily contains performance optimizations. When upgrading:
    1. Remove any custom GC configuration code if present
    2. Thoroughly test in high-load environments before production deployment
