    🔧 Bug Fixes
    - TCP reconnect stability fix: Fixed an issue where subdomain and TCP port would change on client reconnect
      - Persist the assigned subdomain after first connect so reconnects reuse it
      - Allow reserving a specific TCP port when the subdomain is tcp-<port> to prevent port drift
    ⬆️ Upgrade Notes
    This release is fully backward compatible. After upgrading, TCP tunnels will maintain stable access addresses during reconnections caused by network fluctuations.
