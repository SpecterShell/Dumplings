    Flow Control & Reliability Improvements 🎯
    Features
    - Flow Control Protocol: New FlowControl frame type for backpressure
      control between client and server
    - SafeFrame: Automatic frame resource management ensures data is correctly
      returned to memory pool after use
    - Queue Pressure Monitoring: Client monitors dataFrameQueue length and
      automatically sends flow control commands when threshold exceeded
    - Server Backpressure: Added handleFlowControl and sendWithBackpressure
      methods for server-side flow control
    - Panic Recovery: New recovery package with Recoverer and PanicMetrics for
      goroutine panic capture and stack trace logging
    Performance
    - Faster Heartbeat: Reduced heartbeat interval from 5s to 2s, timeout from
      15s to 6s
    - Quicker Shutdown: Reduced forced shutdown wait time from 5s/3s to 2s for
      faster resource reclamation
    - Homepage Response: Converted HTML to byte slices with Content-Length
      header for improved response performance
    Stability
    - SafeFrame Lifecycle: Unified frame lifecycle management with defer
      sf.Close(), preventing memory leaks on abnormal paths
    - Delay Precision: Fixed delay formatting to correctly handle
      microsecond-level delays
