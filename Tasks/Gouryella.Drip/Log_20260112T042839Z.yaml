    Overview
    This release introduces IP-based access control functionality for HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP tunnels, allowing users to restrict access based on client IP addresses using whitelist and blacklist rules.
    New Features
    IP Access Control
    - Whitelist/Blacklist Support: Configure allowed and denied IP addresses for tunnel access
    - CIDR Range Support: Both --allow-ip and --deny-ip flags support CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8)
    - Single IP Support: Individual IP addresses are also supported (automatically converted to /32 for IPv4, /128 for IPv6)
    - Multi-tunnel Support: IP access control works across HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP tunnels
    Usage Examples:
    # Allow only specific IP ranges
    drip http --allow-ip 192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.0/8

    # Deny specific IPs or ranges
    drip tcp --deny-ip 1.2.3.4,192.168.0.0/16

    # Combine allow and deny rules
    drip https --allow-ip 10.0.0.0/8 --deny-ip 10.0.1.0/24
    Access Control Rules:
    1. If IP is in deny list → reject
    2. If whitelist is configured and IP is not in whitelist → reject
    3. Otherwise → allow
    Improvements
    Server Configuration Validation
    - Added Validate method to ServerConfig for validating port ranges, domain format, and TCP port ranges
    - Configuration is now validated before server startup to catch errors early
    - More detailed error messages help users correctly configure server addresses
    Security Enhancements
    - Trusted Proxy Headers: X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers are now only trusted when requests originate from private/loopback networks
    - Private Network Definitions: Added RFC 1918 and other private network range definitions for proxy header validation
    Connection Handling Optimizations
    - Improved channel naming in TCP connections for better code readability
    - Enhanced data copying mechanism with context cancellation support to prevent resource leaks
    - Added JSON serialization error handling in TCP connections to prevent data loss
    Bug Fixes
    - Fixed CIDR parsing in deny list - previously CIDR ranges like 192.168.0.0/16 were silently ignored
    - Fixed context handling logic in pipe callbacks
    - Optimized error handling mechanism for data connection responses
