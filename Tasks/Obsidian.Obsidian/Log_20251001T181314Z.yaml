    - Bases: Formulas using this now work if a Base file is embedded inside Canvas.
    - Bases: Formulas using this now resolve to null if the Base is not in the sidebar and not embedded.

    Developers
    The installer has been updated to use Electron v37.6.0 (requires downloading the latest installer). For users on macOS Tahoe, this maybe improve app performance.
