    This update brings several mild improvements, but main focus was on system compatibility - we updated most frameworks and libraries we use.
    NetLimiter runs on Windows 7 and new systems, but it becomes harder and harder to support older OS. It is not definitive, but we will probably end support for Windows 7 and 8 in first half of the 2026*. Older NetLimiter versions (like the one currently realesed) will still run on old machines, but new updates won't.

    New features
    - New improved tray icon functionality.
    - Added tray icon widget with various tools and infos.
    - Many more texts translated to all supported languages. (If you find any translation problem, please contact us at support@netlimiter.com)
    - Added Pause option to Traffic chart.
    Fixed bugs
    - Traffic chart rare synchorinization bug fixed.
ReleaseTime: 2025-11-24
