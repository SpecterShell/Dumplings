    TigerVNC 1.16.0 is now available. Lots of changes have been made since the last release, but the highlights are:
    - The native viewer has a new keyboard shortcut system to control the viewer, replacing the F8 shortcut and allowing easier access to toggle full-screen mode and redirecting system keys
    - The native viewer now supports sending system keys even in windowed mode
    - Added a new server called w0vncserver for sharing Wayland desktops
    - The Java viewer has more fine-grained control of scaling the session
    - The native viewer uses a different method to intercept system keys on macOS, which will require explicit user approval
    - The native viewer has an improved server field, with searchable history
    - The native viewer now intercepts and forwards all¹ system keys on Windows
    - The native viewer is now more responsive when resizing the remote session
    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 packages have been added, although without libvnc.so
    - Ubuntu 20.04 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 packages have been removed
    ¹ except for Ctrl+Alt+Delete, which can never be intercepted
