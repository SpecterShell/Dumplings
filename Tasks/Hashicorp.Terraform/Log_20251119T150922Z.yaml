    NEW FEATURES:
    - List Resources: List resources can be defined in *.tfquery.hcl files and allow querying and filterting existing infrastructure.
    - A new Terraform command terraform query: Executes list operations against existing infrastructure and displays the results. The command can optionally generate configuration for importing results into Terraform.
    - A new GenerateResourceConfiguration RPC allows providers to create more precise configuration values during import. (#37515)
    - New top-level Actions block: Actions are provider defined and meant to codify use cases outside the normal CRUD model in your Terraform configuration. Providers can define Actions like aws_lambda_invoke or aws_cloudfront_create_invalidation that do something imparative outside of Terraforms normal CRUD model. You can configure such a side-effect with an action block and have actions triggered through the lifecycle of a resource or through passing the -invoke CLI flag. (#37553)
    ENHANCEMENTS:
    - terraform test: expected diagnostics will be included in test output when running in verbose mode" (#37362)
    - terraform test: ignore prevent_destroy attribute during when cleaning up tests" (#37364)
    - terraform stacks command support for -help flag (#37645)
    - query: support offline validation of query files via -query flag in the validate command (#37671)
    - Updates to support the AWS European Sovereign Cloud (#37721)
    BUG FIXES:
    - Retrieve all workspace variables while doing a terraform import, include variables inherited from variable sets but not overwritten by the workspace. (#37241)
    - Fix OSS backend proxy support by adding a proxy layer for OSS backend operations. Resolves hashicorp/terraform#36897. (#36897)
    - console and test: return explicit diagnostics when referencing resources that were not included in the most recent operation. (#37663)
    - query: generate unique resource identifiers for results of expanded list resources (#37681)
    - The CLI now summarizes the number of actions invoked during terraform apply, matching the plan output. (#37689)
    - Allow filesystem functions to return inconsistent results when evaluated within provider configuration (#37854)
    - query: improve error handling for missing identity schemas (#37863)
    UPGRADE NOTES:
    - The parallelism of Terraform operations within container runtimes may be reduced depending on the CPU bandwidth limit setting. (#37436)
    - Building Terraform 1.14 requires macOS Monterey or later (due to being built on Go 1.25 which imposes these requirements) (#37436)
