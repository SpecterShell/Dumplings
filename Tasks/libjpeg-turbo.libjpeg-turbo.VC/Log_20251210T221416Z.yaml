    Significant changes relative to 3.1.2:
    1. Hardened the TurboJPEG API against hypothetical applications that may erroneously call tj*Compress*() or tj*Transform() with a reused JPEG destination buffer pointer while specifying a destination buffer size of 0.
    2. Hardened the TurboJPEG API against hypothetical applications that may erroneously set TJPARAM_LOSSLESS or TJPARAM_COLORSPACE prior to calling tj3EncodeYUV*8() or tj3CompressFromYUV*8(). tj3EncodeYUV*8() and tj3CompressFromYUV*8() now ignore TJPARAM_LOSSLESS and TJPARAM_COLORSPACE.
    3. Hardened the TurboJPEG Java API against hypothetical applications that may erroneously pass huge X or Y offsets to one of the compression, YUV encoding, decompression, or YUV decoding methods, leading to signed integer overflow in the JNI wrapper's buffer size checks that rendered those checks ineffective.
    4. Fixed an issue in the TurboJPEG Java API whereby TJCompressor.getSourceBuf() sometimes returned the buffer from a previous invocation of TJCompressor.loadSourceImage() if the target data precision was changed before the most recent invocation.
    5. Fixed an issue in the PPM reader that caused incorrect pixels to be generated when using tj3LoadImage*() or TJCompressor.loadSourceImage() to load a PBMPLUS (PPM/PGM) file into a CMYK buffer with a different data precision than that of the file.
