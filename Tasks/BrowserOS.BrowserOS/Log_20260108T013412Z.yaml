    BrowserOS - v0.36.0
    ✨ What's new:
    - Agent personalization — Add your own prompts to personalize the agent. Tweak its behavior, adjust how it responds, set your preferred formatting, and more.
    - Toolbar customization — Hide the Hub chat and labels from the settings page to declutter your toolbar.
    - MCP server port stability — The port now stays consistent through browser restarts, so you don't have to keep updating your MCP clients with a new port.
    - Fixed agent install/update issues — We've made the startup experience much smoother. The agent now handles installs and updates more proactively instead of only on the first launch.
