      - Profiles can now be partial - only include the config vars that need an update by the profile
    - fabric - using official pre-built image
    - browseruse - basic implementation of the service, usable but with some significant caveats
    - webui - relaxed healthcheck
    - harbor attach <service> - attach to service STDIN/OUT in interactive mode
    - harbor up <service> --attach - start service and attach immediately
    - harbor profile merge <name> - explicitly merge given profile into the current one
