    User Experience Improvements
    PyroSim 2026.1 delivers meaningful user experience and stability improvements aimed at creating a smoother, more efficient modeling workflow. Expanded support for additional keyboard shortcuts helps users work faster and more intuitively, while updated warnings provide clearer feedback during model setup. Stability has been improved during scenario creation, reducing interruptions in complex projects, and major OpenGL updates have enhanced rendering stability, resulting in more reliable and consistent visualization performance.
    Results Changes
    Results handling in the new PyroSim release has been enhanced to better support common analysis workflows and reduce manual setup. 3D Smoke results are now automatically activated when available, allowing users to immediately visualize smoke behavior without additional configuration. In addition, CSV results data can now be auto-loaded, streamlining access to numerical output and making it easier to review, plot, and post-process simulation results directly after a run completes.
    You can read more about the changes to Results in the Results Documentation.
    Documentation Improvements
    The 2026.1 release includes a major overhaul of the product documentation, focused on making information easier and faster to access. Navigation has been significantly improved through the introduction of pagination, allowing users to move more quickly between sections, while a new document-wide search tool makes it easier to find specific topics and answers. Pages that are new or have been updated are now clearly highlighted, helping users quickly identify what has changed in the latest release.
    In addition, previously separate manuals and content have been consolidated into a single, unified document, reducing fragmentation and simplifying the learning experience. The documentation has also been reorganized to improve the discoverability of related content, making it easier for both new and experienced users to explore features, understand workflows, and find relevant guidance without unnecessary searching.
    Explore the updated documentation by trying the new search tool located at the top of the documentation table of contents, which provides a quick way to jump directly to relevant information. Be sure to review the Examples section (formerly Tutorials) for practical, step-by-step guidance, visit Troubleshooting (previously FAQs) for help resolving common issues, and explore the Advanced Topics and Appendices for deeper technical detail and reference material that support more complex use cases.
    Streamlined Introduction for New Users
    This release introduces a streamlined Introduction and Fundamentals documentation experience designed to help new users get up and running more quickly. The updated materials present core concepts, workflows, and interface elements in a clearer, more focused structure, reducing the learning curve for first-time users. By emphasizing practical fundamentals and approachable explanations, the new documentation makes it easier for users to build confidence and begin creating effective fire modeling projects in PyroSim.
