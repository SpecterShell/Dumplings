  Key: ReleaseNotes
  Value: |-
    - Added claude remote-control subcommand for external builds, enabling local environment serving for all users.
    - Updated plugin marketplace default git timeout from 30s to 120s and added CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_GIT_TIMEOUT_MS to configure.
    - Added support for custom npm registries and specific version pinning when installing plugins from npm sources
    - BashTool now skips login shell (-l flag) by default when a shell snapshot is available, improving command execution performance. Previously this required setting CLAUDE_BASH_NO_LOGIN=true.
    - Fixed a security issue where statusLine and fileSuggestion hook commands could execute without workspace trust acceptance in interactive mode.
    - Tool results larger than 50K characters are now persisted to disk (previously 100K). This reduces context window usage and improves conversation longevity.
    - Fixed a bug where duplicate control_response messages (e.g. from WebSocket reconnects) could cause API 400 errors by pushing duplicate assistant messages into the conversation.
    - Added CLAUDE_CODE_ACCOUNT_UUID, CLAUDE_CODE_USER_EMAIL, and CLAUDE_CODE_ORGANIZATION_UUID environment variables for SDK callers to provide account info synchronously, eliminating a race condition where early telemetry events lacked account metadata.
    - Fixed slash command autocomplete crashing when a plugin's SKILL.md description is a YAML array or other non-string type
    - The /model picker now shows human-readable labels (e.g., "Sonnet 4.5") instead of raw model IDs for pinned model versions, with an upgrade hint when a newer version is available.
