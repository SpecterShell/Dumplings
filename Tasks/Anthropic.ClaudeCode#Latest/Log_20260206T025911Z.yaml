  Value: |-
    - Fixed agent teammate sessions in tmux to send and receive messages
    - Fixed warnings about agent teams not being available on your current plan
    - Added TeammateIdle and TaskCompleted hook events for multi-agent workflows
    - Added support for restricting which sub-agents can be spawned via Task(agent_type) syntax in agent "tools" frontmatter
    - Added memory frontmatter field support for agents, enabling persistent memory with user, project, or local scope
    - Added plugin name to skill descriptions and /skills menu for better discoverability
    - Fixed an issue where submitting a new message while the model was in extended thinking would interrupt the thinking phase
    - Fixed an API error that could occur when aborting mid-stream, where whitespace text combined with a thinking block would bypass normalization and produce an invalid request
    - Fixed API proxy compatibility issue where 404 errors on streaming endpoints no longer triggered non-streaming fallback
    - Fixed an issue where proxy settings configured via settings.json environment variables were not applied to WebFetch and other HTTP requests on the Node.js build
    - Fixed /resume session picker showing raw XML markup instead of clean titles for sessions started with slash commands
    - Improved error messages for API connection failures — now shows specific cause (e.g., ECONNREFUSED, SSL errors) instead of generic "Connection error"
    - Errors from invalid managed settings are now surfaced
    - VSCode: Added support for remote sessions, allowing OAuth users to browse and resume sessions from claude.ai
    - VSCode: Added git branch and message count to the session picker, with support for searching by branch name
    - VSCode: Fixed scroll-to-bottom under-scrolling on initial session load and session switch
