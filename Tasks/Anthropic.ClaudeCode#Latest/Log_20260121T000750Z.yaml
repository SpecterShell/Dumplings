  Value: |-
    - Added history-based autocomplete in bash mode (!) - type a partial command and press Tab to complete from your bash command history
    - Added search to installed plugins list - type to filter by name or description
    - Added support for pinning plugins to specific git commit SHAs, allowing marketplace entries to install exact versions
    - Fixed a regression where the context window blocking limit was calculated too aggressively, blocking users at ~65% context usage instead of the intended ~98%
    - Fixed memory issues that could cause crashes when running parallel subagents
    - Fixed memory leak in long-running sessions where stream resources were not cleaned up after shell commands completed
    - Fixed @ symbol incorrectly triggering file autocomplete suggestions in bash mode
    - Fixed @-mention menu folder click behavior to navigate into directories instead of selecting them
    - Fixed /feedback command generating invalid GitHub issue URLs when description is very long
    - Fixed /context command to show the same token count and percentage as the status line in verbose mode
    - Fixed an issue where /config, /context, /model, and /todos command overlays could close unexpectedly
    - Fixed slash command autocomplete selecting wrong command when typing similar commands (e.g., /context vs /compact)
    - Fixed inconsistent back navigation in plugin marketplace when only one marketplace is configured
    - Fixed iTerm2 progress bar not clearing properly on exit, preventing lingering indicators and bell sounds
    - Improved backspace to delete pasted text as a single token instead of one character at a time
    - [VSCode] Added /usage command to display current plan usage
