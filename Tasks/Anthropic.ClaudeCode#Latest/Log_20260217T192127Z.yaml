  Value: |-
    - Added support for Claude Sonnet 4.6
    - Added support for reading enabledPlugins and extraKnownMarketplaces from --add-dir directories
    - Added spinnerTipsOverride setting to customize spinner tips — configure tips with an array of custom tip strings, and optionally set excludeDefault: true to show only your custom tips instead of the built-in ones
    - Added SDKRateLimitInfo and SDKRateLimitEvent types to the SDK, enabling consumers to receive rate limit status updates including utilization, reset times, and overage information
    - Fixed Agent Teams teammates failing on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry by propagating API provider environment variables to tmux-spawned processes (anthropics/claude-code#23561)
    - Fixed sandbox "operation not permitted" errors when writing temporary files on macOS by using the correct per-user temp directory (anthropics/claude-code#21654)
    - Fixed Task tool (backgrounded agents) crashing with a ReferenceError on completion (anthropics/claude-code#22087)
    - Fixed autocomplete suggestions not being accepted on Enter when images are pasted in the input
    - Fixed skills invoked by subagents incorrectly appearing in main session context after compaction
    - Fixed excessive .claude.json.backup files accumulating on every startup
    - Fixed plugin-provided commands, agents, and hooks not being available immediately after installation without requiring a restart
    - Improved startup performance by removing eager loading of session history for stats caching
    - Improved memory usage for shell commands that produce large output — RSS no longer grows unboundedly with command output size
    - Improved collapsed read/search groups to show the current file or search pattern being processed beneath the summary line while active
    - [VSCode] Improved permission destination choice (project/user/session) to persist across sessions
