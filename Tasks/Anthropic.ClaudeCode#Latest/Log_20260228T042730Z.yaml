- Locale: en-US
  Key: ReleaseNotes
  Value: |-
    - Added /simplify and /batch bundled slash commands
    - Fixed local slash command output like /cost appearing as user-sent messages instead of system messages in the UI
    - Project configs & auto memory now shared across git worktrees of the same repository
    - Added ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=false env var to opt out from making claude.ai MCP servers available
    - Improved /model command to show the currently active model in the slash command menu
    - Added HTTP hooks, which can POST JSON to a URL and receive JSON instead of running a shell command
    - Fixed listener leak in bridge polling loop
    - Fixed listener leak in MCP OAuth flow cleanup
    - Added manual URL paste fallback during MCP OAuth authentication. If the automatic localhost redirect doesn't work, you can paste the callback URL to complete authentication.
    - Fixed memory leak when navigating hooks configuration menu
    - Fixed listener leak in interactive permission handler during auto-approvals
    - Fixed file count cache ignoring glob ignore patterns
    - Fixed memory leak in bash command prefix cache
    - Fixed MCP tool/resource cache leak on server reconnect
    - Fixed IDE host IP detection cache incorrectly sharing results across ports
    - Fixed WebSocket listener leak on transport reconnect
    - Fixed memory leak in git root detection cache that could cause unbounded growth in long-running sessions
    - Fixed memory leak in JSON parsing cache that grew unbounded over long sessions
    - VSCode: Fixed remote sessions not appearing in conversation history
    - Fixed a race condition in the REPL bridge where new messages could arrive at the server interleaved with historical messages during the initial connection flush, causing message ordering issues.
    - Fixed memory leak where long-running teammates retained all messages in AppState even after conversation compaction
    - Fixed a memory leak where MCP server fetch caches were not cleared on disconnect, causing growing memory usage with servers that reconnect frequently
    - Improved memory usage in long sessions with subagents by stripping heavy progress message payloads during context compaction
    - Added "Always copy full response" option to the /copy picker. When selected, future /copy commands will skip the code block picker and copy the full response directly.
    - VSCode: Added session rename and remove actions to the sessions list
    - Fixed /clear not resetting cached skills, which could cause stale skill content to persist in the new conversation
