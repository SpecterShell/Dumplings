  Key: ReleaseNotes
  Value: |-
    - Added --worktree (-w) flag to start Claude in an isolated git worktree
    - Subagents support isolation: "worktree" for working in a temporary git worktree
    - Added Ctrl+F keybinding to kill background agents (two-press confirmation)
    - Agent definitions support background: true to always run as a background task
    - Plugins can ship settings.json for default configuration
    - Fixed file-not-found errors to suggest corrected paths when the model drops the repo folder
    - Fixed Ctrl+C and ESC being silently ignored when background agents are running and the main thread is idle. Pressing twice within 3 seconds now kills all background agents.
    - Fixed prompt suggestion cache regression that reduced cache hit rates.
    - Fixed plugin enable and plugin disable to auto-detect the correct scope when --scope is not specified, instead of always defaulting to user scope
    - Simple mode (CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE) now includes the file edit tool in addition to the Bash tool, allowing direct file editing in simple mode.
    - Permission suggestions are now populated when safety checks trigger an ask response, enabling SDK consumers to display permission options
    - Sonnet 4.5 with 1M context is being removed from the Max plan in favor of our frontier Sonnet 4.6 model, which now has 1M context. Please switch in /model.
    - Fixed verbose mode not updating thinking block display when toggled via /config — memo comparators now correctly detect verbose changes
    - Fixed unbounded WASM memory growth during long sessions by periodically resetting the tree-sitter parser
    - Fixed potential rendering issues caused by stale yoga layout references
    - Improved performance in non-interactive mode (-p) by skipping unnecessary API calls during startup
    - Improved performance by caching authentication failures for HTTP and SSE MCP servers, avoiding repeated connection attempts to servers requiring auth
    - Fixed unbounded memory growth during long-running sessions caused by Yoga WASM linear memory never shrinking
    - SDK model info now includes supportsEffort, supportedEffortLevels, and supportsAdaptiveThinking fields so consumers can discover model capabilities.
    - Added ConfigChange hook event that fires when configuration files change during a session, enabling enterprise security auditing and optional blocking of settings changes.
    - Improved startup performance by caching MCP auth failures to avoid redundant connection attempts
    - Improved startup performance by reducing HTTP calls for analytics token counting
    - Improved startup performance by batching MCP tool token counting into a single API call
    - Fixed disableAllHooks setting to respect managed settings hierarchy — non-managed settings can no longer disable managed hooks set by policy (#26637)
    - Fixed --resume session picker showing raw XML tags for sessions that start with commands like /clear. Now correctly falls through to the session ID fallback.
    - Improved permission prompts for path safety and working directory blocks to show the reason for the restriction instead of a bare prompt with no context
