  Value: |-
    - Claude Opus 4.6 is now available!
    - Added research preview agent teams feature for multi-agent collaboration (token-intensive feature, requires setting CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1)
    - Claude now automatically records and recalls memories as it works
    - Added "Summarize from here" to the message selector, allowing partial conversation summarization.
    - Skills defined in .claude/skills/ within additional directories (--add-dir) are now loaded automatically.
    - Fixed @ file completion showing incorrect relative paths when running from a subdirectory
    - Updated --resume to re-use --agent value specified in previous conversation by default.
    - Fixed: Bash tool no longer throws "Bad substitution" errors when heredocs contain JavaScript template literals like ${index + 1}, which previously interrupted tool execution
    - Skill character budget now scales with context window (2% of context), so users with larger context windows can see more skill descriptions without truncation
    - Fixed Thai/Lao spacing vowels (สระ า, ำ) not rendering correctly in the input field
    - VSCode: Fixed slash commands incorrectly being executed when pressing Enter with preceding text in the input field
    - VSCode: Added spinner when loading past conversations list
