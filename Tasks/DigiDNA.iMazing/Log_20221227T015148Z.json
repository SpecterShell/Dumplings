This issue was occurring while downloading apps, installing apps, exporting app data, exporting ePub books and in various other places.\n- Messages: optimized loading of messages (macOS)\n- Music: fixed width of Title, Artist and Album columns. If you encountered an issue with the width of those columns, go to the iMazing main menu: View > Media Browser > Reset media view to default settings (macOS)"
