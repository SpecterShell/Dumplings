    What's new in TextExpander 8.4
    New Feature: Date Picker
    Date Picker lets you quickly choose the exact date you need—past, present, or future—right from a calendar and insert it directly into a Snippet as it expands. No more flipping between apps or typing dates by hand.
    It’s perfect for:
    - Scheduling appointments and follow-ups
    - Referencing deadlines or due dates
    - Communicating timelines or reminders
    - Inserting dates of birth or submission dates
    Fixes & Improvements:
    - Improved sync reliability: Updates now sync seamlessly without needing to log out and back in.
    - Snippet group sync: Fixed rare issues with renamed or deleted snippet groups not syncing correctly across devices.
