    Security
    - This release addresses CVE-2025-9566, where Kubernetes YAML run by podman play kube containing ConfigMap and Secret volumes can use crafted symlinks to overwrite content on the host.
    Bugfixes
    - Fixed a bug where network creation and removal events were displayed incorrectly when the journald events driver was in use.
    - Fixed a bug where the --security-opt seccomp=unconfined option was broken on Windows (#26855).
    - Fixed a bug where containers created with a name longer than 64 characters, no explicit hostname, the the container_name_as_hostname option in containers.conf set to true would fail to start.
    - Fixed a bug where Podman would fail to start containers when runc 1.3.0 or later was used as the OCI runtime (#26938).
    Misc
    - Adjusted the systemd-tmpfiles script to recursively remove temporary files directories placed in /tmp, ensuring proper operation of Podman after a reboot if /tmp is not a tmpfs.
    - Updated Buildah to v1.41.4
    - Updated the containers/storage to v1.59.1
    - Updated the containers/common library to v0.64.2
