Consolidated scrolling code so they all call the same function to do the window/class checks!\n- #802 - Add further logging around any call to set cursor speed, also log the cursor speed set in Windows when hooking the mouse (eg. resume from sleep) to diagnose random cursor speed changes.\n- #800 - Add ability to customise the Enhanced Pointer Precision threshold values used in Windows to affect acceleration (manually editing the XML settings until 2.21)\n- #799 - Fixed Win11 22H2 Volume scroll over taskbar broken by XMBC scroll window under cursor.\n- #791 - Further structural changes to try and prevent XMBC from crashing in the audio/volume manager when resuming from sleep, under certain (rare) circumstances.             Also fixed a crash in 2.20.2 related to logging debug messages."
