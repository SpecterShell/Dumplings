    🚀 Escrcpy 2.0.0 — AutoGLM-Powered Intelligent Device Control
    Escrcpy 2.0.0 is a milestone major release. This version delivers a comprehensive architectural refactor across the entire project, deeply integrates AutoGLM, and officially introduces natural-language-driven automation for single-device and multi-device control. In addition, it brings system-level improvements to stability, concurrency control, the subscription model, and UI/UX.

    ✨ Major Highlights
    🤖 Copilot Major Overhaul (AutoGLM)
    - Comprehensive architectural refactor with deep AutoGLM integration
    - Natural language control: execute complex device operations with a single instruction
    - Supports both fine-grained single-device control and batch execution across multiple devices
    - Introduces a conversational device control mode for clearer, more traceable operations
    - Real-time streaming output with immediate visibility into task execution
    - Visualized task status (In Progress / Success / Failure)

    🧠 Deep AutoGLM Integration
    - Initial completion of deep AutoGLM adaptation within Escrcpy
    - Unified entry point for multi-device batch control (autoglm.js)
    - Isolated execution per device to prevent cross-task interference
    - Improved AutoGLM executable management and runtime environment injection
    - Enhanced environment variable handling and output stability on Windows

    ⚙️ Device Control & Automation Enhancements
    - Support for batch task execution across multiple devices
    - New scheduled task capability with Cron expression support
      - Timed execution
      - Periodic automated control
    - Batch operations
      - Batch device deletion
      - Batch task deletion
    - Automatic installation of the ADB input method
    - Automatic restoration of the system default input method after text input
    - Improved usability and interaction of the device control toolbar

    🔐 Subscription & API Key Management
    As AutoGLM relies on third-party model services, a subscription system is officially introduced in this release.
    - New subscription and billing module
    - Optimized subscription workflow, page layout, and interaction details
    - Support for custom API Key configuration within the device conversation view
    - Improved local storage structure and naming conventions
    - Enhanced overall stability after subscription login

    🧩 IPC & Process Management Improvements
    - Introduced electron-ipcx to simplify and standardize IPC communication
    - Refactored process management for improved reliability and maintainability
    - Added node-pty support to enhance terminal and subprocess interaction
    - Improved concurrency control with configurable concurrency limits

    🎨 UI / UX Redesign
    - Comprehensive UI/UX overhaul
    - Support for an immersive menu bar
    - Updated action icon system with improved visual clarity
    - Optimized action bar layout and interaction feedback
    - Enhanced Copilot conversation layout and message presentation
    - Windows UI upgraded to the new design system
    - Unified visual style across global UI and subscription modules

    ⚡ Performance Improvements
    - Significant improvements to Copilot concurrent execution performance
    - Optimized multi-device task scheduling and isolation
    - Refactored debug logging system to reduce performance overhead
    - Removed redundant code to improve overall maintainability
    - Optimized file manager layout and component naming conventions
    - Improved shortcut commands and command management experience

    🐛 Bug Fixes
    - Fixed packaging configuration issues
    - Fixed page errors after subscription login
    - Fixed unregistered billing service API issues
    - Fixed garbled Copilot output on Windows
    - Fixed execution failures caused by environment variable injection issues

    🏗 Project & Infrastructure
    - Refactored overall project architecture
    - Rebuilt the foundational configuration system
    - Synchronized and optimized internationalization resources
    - Upgraded scrcpy to v3.3.4

    📌 Summary
    Escrcpy 2.0.0 marks the project’s official entry into the AI-driven era of intelligent device control.
    With AutoGLM, device interaction evolves from “tool-based operations” to natural language interaction.
