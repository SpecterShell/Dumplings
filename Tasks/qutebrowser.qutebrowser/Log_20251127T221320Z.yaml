    Changed
    - Windows and macOS releases now ship with Qt 6.10.1, which include security patches up to Chromium 142.0.7444.162.
    Fixed
    - The version info now includes the Wayland compositor name if wayland-client is available under a different name than libwayland-client.so (#8771).
    - The list of Chromium extensions in --version / :version now uses the correct Chromium data profile, also fixing a crash with Qt 6.10.1 (#8785).
    - With Qt 6.10.1, qt.workarounds.disable_hangouts_extension now doesn’t apply on private profiles, avoiding a Qt bug leading to a crash (#8785).
