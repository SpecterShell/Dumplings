    New Page Display Mode

    In the Pages panel, you can use button no. 9 to choose one of four page display modes:
    1. page sequence number
    2. short page name (the mode used in previous versions)
    3. sequence number, period and page name
    4. custom text using variables (e.g. {_po} - {project})
    Write variable names between curly braces { and }.
    This setting is saved separately for each document.
    If the original mode suits you, there is no need to change anything in existing documents. You can use the new, more descriptive display mode only for new documents.
    Where to enter page variable values
    Double-click a page in the Pages panel to open the dialog box.
    Then switch to the Variables tab.
    Page variables with print reports
    When you insert a print report into the project using button 6, the program automatically sets these two variables:
    - name – the name of the print report, e.g. "Bill of Materials" or "List of Wires"
    - short name – a three-letter code according to the following table:
    code report name
    BOM bill of materials
    LOC list of cables
    LOT list of terminals
    LOP list of pages
    LOW list of wires
    Colorful Explorer Display
    Items in the Explorer panel now have colored backgrounds according to their type for better clarity.
