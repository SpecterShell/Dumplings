    Improvements
    - Added validation for the sentry-cli build upload command's --head-sha and --base-sha arguments (#2945). The CLI now validates that these are valid SHA1 sums. Passing an empty string is also allowed; this prevents the default values from being used, causing the values to instead be unset.
    Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where providing empty-string values for the sentry-cli build upload command's --vcs-provider, --head-repo-name, --head-ref, --base-ref, and --base-repo-name arguments resulted in 400 errors (#2946). Now, setting these to empty strings instead explicitly clears the default value we would set otherwise, as expected.
