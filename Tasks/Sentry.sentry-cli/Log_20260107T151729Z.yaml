    Fixes
    - Fixed a bug on ARM-based macOS systems that prevented Sentry CLI from respecting self-signed certificates trusted in the macOS keychain (#3057).
    Versioning Policy Update
    Our versioning policy has reclassified the minimum supported self-hosted Sentry version as being part of the public API. Therefore, we will only increase this minimum supported self-hosted Sentry version in a major release of Sentry CLI.
