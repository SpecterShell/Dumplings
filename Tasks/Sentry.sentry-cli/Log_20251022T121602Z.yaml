    New Features
    - (JS API) Add projects field to SentryCliUploadSourceMapsOptions (#2856)
    Deprecations
    - Deprecated the upload-proguard subcommand's --app-id, --version, and --version-code flags (#2852), as we plan to remove these flags in Sentry CLI 3.x. Users should simply stop using the flags; the values specified there have never had an effect on deobfuscation, and are no longer visible in Sentry.
    - Added a deprecation notice for release bundle uploads, a legacy method for uploading source maps (#2844). Release bundle uploads will be removed in Sentry CLI 3.x in favor of artifact bundles, the newer source map upload method introduced in Sentry version 23.6.2. Self-hosted users: You must upgrade to Sentry 23.6.2 or later before upgrading to Sentry CLI 3.x.
    Fixes
    - Fixed a bug where some log messages would not show up in CI environments or when redirecting stderr to a file (#2830). Specifically, this bug was affecting any subcommand that uses a progress bar, such as sentry-cli debug-files bundle-jvm and sentry-cli sourcemaps upload. Any stderr output during the progress bar was lost if stderr was redirected.
