    Features
    - Added instance properties editor. #257
      Moved basic instance edits (label, colour) and management (deletion) to a settings modal. It reduces the risk of accidentally deleting an instance, improves accessibility with clearer UI structure, and unifies the experience between basic and local instances.
    Improvements
    - Added standardised installer naming. #244
      Adopted standardised installer naming, using penpot-desktop-<architecture>.<extension> pattern (e.g. penpot-desktop-arm64.exe). It enables linking to the right installer for your operating system using GitHub Releases latest tag's endpoint.
    - Added Flathub keywords. By @razzeee #246
      Added keywords to the project's meta info for better discoverability in Flathub.
