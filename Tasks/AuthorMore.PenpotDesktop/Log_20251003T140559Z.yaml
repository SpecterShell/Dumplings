    Features
    - Added local instance update support. #223
      Added capability to edit a local instance’s settings and update its containers. An update will recreate the containers, and if you use the “latest” tag, the instance will upgrade to the newest available Penpot version.
      The creator can be opened in the edit mode through an instance panel's context menu.
