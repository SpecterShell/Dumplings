    - [macOS] Added signing and notarisation of the macOS builds. #230
      üö¶ macOS builds will now be recognised by Gatekeeper and work without quarantine bypass. On the first run, they will have the familiar pop-up about an application downloaded from the Internet.
      ‚¨ÜÔ∏è With signed builds, Penpot Desktop should be able to keep itself up to date using automated updates; with the application's built-in auto-updater.
