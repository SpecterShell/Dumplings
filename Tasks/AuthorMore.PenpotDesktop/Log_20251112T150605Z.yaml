    Features
    - Added option to open view mode in a window. #240
      You can choose to open view mode in a separate window instead of a new tab.
    - Added auto-reload option for view mode. #239
      You can enable automatic reloads for view mode so a view-mode tab or window refreshes when a Penpot file changes.
