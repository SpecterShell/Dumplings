    Final 6000.3.0f1 Release Notes
    Features
    - 2D: Added Mesh Renderer and Skinned Mesh Renderer 2D workflow support for 2D URP.
    - Accessibility: Extended the platform support of the screen reader support APIs to Windows and macOS, allowing Unity desktop applications to be made compatible with Narrator (Windows) and VoiceOver (macOS).
    - Android: Added app category support to allow users to retain Android 15 orientation and rotation behavior when running on Android 16.
    - Android: Added AppCategory analytics to support the collection of app category data.
    - Android: Added HTTP/2 support for UnityWebRequest on Android.
    - Audio: In the global audio project settings, if the "Audio Foundation" property is set to "Enhanced", a new platform audio foundation is used on Windows and macOS. More platforms will be supported in future versions of Unity. In enhanced mode, the Unity audio engine will run at the channel layout and sampling rate selected via the new "Output Channel Layout" and "Output Sampling Rate" properties. The enhanced audio foundation executes the format conversions necessary to translate from the engine's format to the audio device's native format. This avoids the current issue where the audio engine may reset and lose all state when the default audio output device changes. In addition, in enhanced mode, all expensive platform audio operations, like enumerating, starting, and stopping devices, are all executed off the main thread, so there should be no more main thread hitches.
    - Build System: Set up Bee to better use with either MSVC dynamic or static CRT.
    - Editor: Added new functionality to the Editor dialog box API that will allow for icon choices, and opt out choices. Refer to EditorDialog in the Unity Documentation for more details.
    - Editor: Added performance indicators to the Windows Editor launch window. These indicators display when the Editor is built from source or the Developer Mode Editor preference is enabled.
    - Editor: Added SceneView debug labels and color coded bounds for MeshRenderer and SkinnedMeshRenderer to display active Mesh LOD for meshes with LODs.
    - Editor: Added the ability to dock overlays as full-height dynamic panels in the Scene view.
    - Editor: Made the Editor Launch Screen draggable on Linux.
    - Editor: Moved Adaptive Performance 6 from a package to the Unity core. Bundled provider packages with the Unity Editor.

    - GI: Published the Unified Raytracing API, which provides an API for creating cross-platform ray tracing shaders.
    - Graphics: Added Split Graphics Jobs support to Metal.
    - Graphics: Added support for hit shaders in .raytrace files. The GPU executes the hit shaders by default if the expected Shader Pass (specified using RayTracingShader.SetShaderPass) is not found in .shader files used by geometries in the acceleration structure.
    - Graphics: Added MeshRenderer and SkinnedMeshRenderer shader user value API to set a per-renderer unsigned int value. This value can be retrieved in shader code to modify the shader value per object, using a single material.
    - IL2CPP: Backport metadata reductions: reduce size of string literal data and type definition data by computing the length of each string during deserialization, removing Il2CppTypeDefinition::elementTypeIndex, and encoding the elementType in Il2CppTypeDefinition::parentIndex.
    - Kepler: Enabled HTTP/2 functionality and optimal extra HTTP/2 settings on Kepler.
    - License: Enabled the Package Manager to check entitlements for Asset Store Unity Package Manager (UPM) packages and regular packages.

    - Package Manager: Users can now easily create packages from the Package Manager window.
    - Physics 2D: Added conversion operators for LowLevelPhysics2D.PhysicsJoint.

    - Physics 2D: Added new low-level 2D physics API based upon Box2D v3. This does not interact with or change the existing API or components at this time. Later, this new API will replace the existing API and be integrated into the existing components.
    - Physics 2D: The LowLevelPhysics2D renderer now performs orthographic render culling, which significantly improves debug rendering performance in large scenes.
    - Physics 2D: The LowLevelPhysics2D.PhysicsRotate property drawer now shows angles labelled as "Angle" and not "Degrees".
    - Player: Added support for building dedicated server players that target Linux Arm64 platforms using IL2CPP.

These options enable you to more effectively create custom lighting models using the Unlit target. For examples, refer to the Shader Graph Custom Lighting sample content in the documentation.
    - Shaders: Users can now add project-wide shader keyword list declaration overrides from Graphics Settings. This update allows users to switch between statically compiled variants and dynamic branching and completely remove keywords that are never used.
    - SRP Core: Added the ability to connect to player builds in the Render Graph Viewer.
    - Terrain: Added Shader Graph support for terrain shaders. This update includes support for the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) and Universal Render Pipeline (URP), a new subtarget type, and a new node for loading terrain data.

    - UI Toolkit: Implemented UITK ShaderGraph Master Node.
    - UI Toolkit: Released UI Test Framework 1.0 Package.
    - Universal RP: Added Kawase and Dual filtering options for Bloom. These filters trade quality for performance and are primarily intended for mobile platforms:
      - Kawase filtering is optimized for smaller resolutions.
      - Dual filtering is suitable for larger resolutions.
      - Gaussian filtering remains the best choice for quality and stability.
        Each filter requires unique settings to achieve visual parity.
    - Universal Windows Platform: Enabled HTTP/2 functionality on Universal Windows, including optimal HTTP/2 settings.
    - URP: Added a Disabled option for the intermediate texture in URP.
    - URP: Added On Tile Post Processing rendering features in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for untethered XR platforms.

    Improvements
    - 2D: Added tooltips to properties for the TilesetImporter editor.
    - 2D: Improved performance of instantiation of GameObjects from Tiles. (UUM-110584)
    - 2D: Increased the default alpha level of the Tile Palette Grid when the Editor is in Light mode, to make the Grid more visible. (UUM-113207)
    - 2D: SpiteAtlas previews can now be packed and previewed asynchronously, which prevents the Editor from freezing during these operations. Previously, packing SpriteAtlas previews did an internal import when enabled for builds in an synchronous way and then displayed sprites. This also fixes an issue where all Atlases are packed when Atlas preview is clicked in certain cases, now only the atlas that is selected to be previewed is packed.
    - Android: Added an option to Player Settings to disable the automatic creation of a Presentation for rendering camera that target Display 2 when a presentation display is detected.

    - Bug Reporter: Added copy and open functionality for attachment paths.
    - DX12: You can set ID3D12GraphicsCommandListIASetVertexBuffers once instead of several times in a loop inside GfxDeviceD3D12BaseDrawBuffersCommon. (UUM-109282)
    - Editor: - Remove the Description Foldout in favor of a text block.
      - Adjust the sizes of the default platform icons.
