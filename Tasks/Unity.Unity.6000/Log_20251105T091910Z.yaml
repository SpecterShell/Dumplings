    6000.0.62f1 Release Notes
    Improvements
    - URP: Added logging for SDR rendering configuration when 10-Bit HDR Output is active. This helps you understand what to expect and any automatic adjustments URP makes. Refer to [Use Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) Rendering with HDR Output enabled](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.3/Documentation/Manual/urp/post-processing/hdr-output.html\) for more details. (UUM-115727)

    - URP: Modified Universal Render Pipeline HDR Output behavior to maintain 16-bit HDR Output when switching to Render Pipeline Assets that don't support HDR Rendering. (UUM-115727)
    Fixes
    - 2D: Clean up and fix mesh and sprite normals for shadergraph. (UUM-121472)
    - 2D: Fixed issue where "Invalid AABB inAABB" and "Assertion failed on expression: 'awake.loadStarted'" errors are thrown when when instantiating a prefab with InstantiateAsync. (UUM-120045)

    - DX12: Fixed memory leak in certain scenarios when using DX12 + Graphics Jobs (split mode). (UUM-120637)
    - DX12: Fixed RenderPass stencil access validation error (ID 1377). (UUM-122912)
    - Editor: Burst SharedStatic memory is now cleared prior to object deserialization, which fixes a crash that could occur if jobs are scheduled during object deserialization. (UUM-77850)
    - Editor: Editor: Editor: Editor: Set the new input system to manage move and look and the MixedFov and Shader/Lit scenes from the URP samples. (UUM-71847)
