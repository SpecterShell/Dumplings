    Today we released PIX 2602.25 and 2602.25-preview, which can be downloaded here. These releases include everything in the previous 2601.15 release, plus:
    - 2602.25: includes support for all of the new D3D12 features released today in Agility SDK 619.0, including Shader Model 6.9, DXR 1.2 (OMMs, SER), revised view creation, and more.
    - 2602.25-preview: includes everything in 2602.25, plus support for new D3D12 preview features in Agility SDK 719.0 such as fence barriers and extensions.
    By default we recommend that all PIX users use non-preview versions of PIX (e.g. 2502.25). We only recommend that you use preview versions of PIX (e.g. 2602.25-preview) if you are trying out new preview D3D12 features.
    Both versions of PIX include correctness fixes and quality-of-life improvements listed below. As usual, please get in touch with us if you have any feedback or hit any issues! The best ways to contact us are via the Send Feedback button in PIX or via the #pix channel on the DirectX Discord server.
