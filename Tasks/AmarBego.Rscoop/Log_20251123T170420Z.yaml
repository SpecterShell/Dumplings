    Release Notes 1.4.5
    New Features
    - Native MSI Launch Fix: Rscoop now automatically detects if it was launched in a restricted MSI context (common after fresh installs) and seamlessly relaunches itself with correct permissions and working directory. The "MSI Launch Notice" screen has been removed.
    - Enhanced Manifest Viewer: The manifest viewer now features improved syntax highlighting (Atom One Dark), a copy-to-clipboard button, and a cleaner UI.
    Improvements
    - Massive Backend Refactor:
      - Non-blocking Operations: Heavy tasks like searching, status checks, and updates now run in non-blocking threads, keeping the UI responsive even during intensive operations.
      - Modular Architecture: Scheduler logic moved to a dedicated module; cleaner separation of concerns across commands.
      - Robust Junction Handling: The linker now uses multiple strategies (std fs, cmd, PowerShell) to reliably remove and create junctions, fixing issues with version switching.
    - State Management: Package info modals now automatically update their state after operations (install/uninstall/update) without needing to close and reopen.
    - Performance: Optimized file system scanning and modification time checks.
    - Packages without Buckets: Packages without buckets display normally and warn the User the bucket is missing
    - Moved View Manifest Button: Moved to the Modal itself for ease of access for power-users
    - Slight theming and consistency Improvements: To unify it better text and colors have been slightly adjusted
    Bug Fixes
    - Versioned Installs: Fixed issues where install.json was missing or unreadable for versioned package installs.
    - Bucket Manifests: Improved logic for locating and counting manifests within buckets, supporting both flat and nested structures.
    - Auto-Cleanup: Ensure auto-cleanup is reliably triggered after uninstalling packages or clearing cache.
    - Search: Fixed JSON parsing for bin fields in manifests to correctly identify binary matches.
    Next Version
    - Light Mode: Next version will include a light theme
    - Accent Colors: Selectable accent colors
