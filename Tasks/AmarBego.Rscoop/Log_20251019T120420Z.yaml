    Release Notes
    Added
    - Debug mode with floating debug button for accessing system information, logs, and troubleshooting tools (toggle in Settings).
    - New debug commands (get_debug_info, get_app_logs, read_app_log_file) for detailed system diagnostics.
    Improved
    - Drastically reduced log volume through intelligent caching and debouncing:
      - Cold-start now logs efficiently with early-break optimization (no retry spam).
      - Installed packages scan uses fingerprint-based caching with 1-second debouncing to eliminate rapid re-scans.
      - Held packages lookup includes memoization checks to prevent redundant filesystem walks.
      - Linker version enumeration uses package version cache to avoid directory walking on every call.
      - LNK shortcut parsing reduced from per-file logging to single summary line.
      - External crate logging (lnk, reqwest, tauri_plugin_updater) now gated at appropriate levels.
    - Cold-start initialization now parallel-prefetches installed packages and manifest cache without blocking delays.
    - App state refactored with encapsulated scoop_path() getter/setter and refresh-time tracking for debouncing.
    - Package versions cache architecture similar to installed packages cache, tied to installed packages fingerprint.
    - Eliminated blocking retry loops during cold-start; .msi symlink settling is handled gracefully via fallback to latest version directory.
    - Manifest cache warming during cold start ensures first search is instant without re-scanning buckets.
    - Search command now reports cache status and timing information for better observability.
    - Cold-start now completes faster by removing synchronous sleep delays that were blocking the parallel package scan.
    Documentation
    - Removed a README notice describing the known update/fresh-install bug (as its now fixed on .msi installers).
    - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for debug information and log inspection.
