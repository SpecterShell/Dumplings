    Release Notes
    Added
    - MSI Installation Support: The app now detects when you install via the Windows .msi installer and shows a helpful notice with simple instructions to relaunch for full functionality.
    - Proper App Close: Fixed the app close button to work reliably.
    Improved
    - Cleaner Logging: Simplified backend logging for easier troubleshooting.
    - Faster Startup: Optimized the cold-start initialization process.
    - Better User Experience: App no longer attempts to run in a limited stateâ€”just ask you to restart, which takes about a second.
    Fixed
    - MSI Installation Issue: When you install Rscoop via the .msi installer, Windows temporarily runs it in a restricted mode. The app now detects this and politely asks you to close and reopen it from the Start Menu for normal functionality.
    Documentation
    - Updated guides to reflect the improved .msi installation experience.
    - Cleaned up outdated notes about restart requirements.
