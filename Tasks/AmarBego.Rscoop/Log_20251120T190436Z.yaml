    Added
    - Settings Page Redesign: Settings are now organized into clear tabs (Automation, Management, Security, Window & UI, About) for faster navigation.
    - Automatic Bucket & Package Updates: Background scheduler with wall-clock persistence auto-updates buckets and optionally packages after bucket refresh. Supports custom intervals and short debug intervals.
    - Start on Boot: New Startup toggle lets Rscoop launch automatically with Windows; integrates version-aware MSI mismatch handling.
    Improved
    - Version-Aware Launch Behavior: Updated builds trigger a mismatch notice even on auto-start to ensure a clean post-update relaunch.
