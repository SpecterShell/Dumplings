    Release Notes 1.4.3
    Added
    - Settings Page Redesign: Settings are now organized into clear tabs (Automation, Management, Security, Window & UI, About) for faster navigation.
    - Automatic Bucket & Package Updates: Background scheduler with wall-clock persistence auto-updates buckets and optionally packages after bucket refresh. Supports custom intervals and short debug intervals.
    - Start on Boot: New Startup toggle lets Rscoop launch automatically with Windows; integrates version-aware MSI mismatch handling.
    - Auto cleanup: Automatically clean up old versions and cache on install/update and uninstall
    Improved
    - Version-Aware Launch Behavior: Updated builds trigger a mismatch notice even on auto-start to ensure a clean post-update relaunch.

    Bug Fixes / Reliability
    - Startup Event Race: Registered cold-start and readiness listeners before any asynchronous update/network checks to prevent missed backend events causing long (10s) spinner fallback.
    - Updater Timeout Stall: Moved update check to deferred phase after readiness with a 4s timeout safeguard so a slow/failed request no longer blocks initial UI rendering.
    - Duplicate Emissions Reduced: Added is_cold_start_ready backend command to allow future polling and reduce reliance on repeated multi-attempt event emission loops.
    - Loading Screen Variability: Eliminated cases where loading screen persisted until fallback due to late listener registration; readiness now reflects actual cold-start completion promptly.
    - Resilience on Network Errors: Gracefully logs updater failures without elevating severity or holding UI readiness state.
    - Debug logs: Now rotate upon launch to not cause exhaustive debugs
