    - 中文更新日志及讨论：https://discussion.listary.com/t/v6-3-1-79-beta/9404
    Main Updates​
    - New: refactored custom indexing to provide a more stable and superior user experience:
      - New: You can now search while creating or updating a custom index.

    - New: Non-Pro users can now also create custom indexes.

    - New: View the indexing status at any time (including the number of files and the last update time).
    - New: Index updates now use incremental updates, making the process faster.
    - New: Support for manually updating custom indexes.

    Other Updates​
    - New: Added setting in Options > Hotkeys > Show Listary. Double-clicking Ctrl again in the launcher can now hide it or switch to file search.
    - New: Added setting in Options > General > Use Software Render (default off). Intel integrated graphics users with memory issues can enable this option.
    - Improved: If a search result icon fails to load, a default icon will be displayed instead.
    - Improved: The installer now disables support for Windows 7, with the minimum supported version being Windows 8.
    - Improved: Adopted WPF software rendering to enhance compatibility and prevent memory leaks caused by driver issues with some Intel integrated graphics cards.
    - Improved: Implemented periodic retry for custom index target folders that are inaccessible.
    - Fixed: Resolved machine code changes causing extra activation count usage.
    - Fixed: Addressed an issue where mapped network drives might not be indexed.
    - Fixed: Resolved an issue where custom indexing failed to index some files in certain scenarios.
    - Fixed: Addressed a crash in the search engine that occurred when canceling a foreground search under specific conditions.
    - Fixed: Resolved known crashes and improved search engine stability.
    - Fixed: High CPU usage when there are a large number of file changes.
    - Fixed: The possibility of a crash when rapidly clicking “Rebuild Index” in the settings interface.
    - Fixed: When typing too quickly during a web search, the opened page may not match the user’s input.
