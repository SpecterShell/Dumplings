    The following new features and changes are included:
    - The lower modulation limit for heat pumps is now better taken into account in the simulation. This applies to both simulation and data entry. The product dialog for heat pumps has been revised in terms of performance data and operating limits for the display and entry of product data. This change often results in a slight increase in the seasonal performance factors, as the performance of the heat pump no longer drops as sharply. Furthermore, heat pumps that actually have increasing efficiency in partial load operation are now better represented.
    - In system WPA 8, the heat pump is only used for preheating domestic hot water. This significantly increases the boiler's share of the load, and the heat pump no longer has to deliver such high flow temperatures.
    - The product selection dialog has been updated and made clearer.
    - The bivalence point diagram has been expanded to include the minimum heating output of the heat pump.
    - The demand for domestic hot water can now also be entered as annual energy demand and specific annual energy demand.
    - Loading the database at program startup and database access have been accelerated.
    - New program language: Czech.
    - The databases have been updated.
    The following bugs have been fixed:
    - Crash of the project report when a project image was selected on the Project Data page.
    - Crash when the product selection dialog was closed during a full-text search.
    - Crash when entering a custom soil type for the geothermal collector.
    - Graphic of the auxiliary heater in the bivalence point diagram was incorrect.
    - The flow temperature of the boiler was missing in the result graphics for bivalent systems.
    - The diagram type of the data series was not saved in the result graphics.
    - No brine water heat pumps with an intermediate circuit were permitted when groundwater was used as the heat source.
    - The flow temperatures in the predefined profiles of the result graphics were incorrect.
    - Crash when selecting certain domestic hot water storage tanks.
    - Seasonal performance factors were sometimes calculated and displayed incorrectly.
