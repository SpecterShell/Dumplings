    Pattern tab
    - [Fix] <js> Since OpenMPT 1.31, having both "Contiunous scroll" and "Cursor wrap in pattern editor" disabled, jumping by beat or measure no longer jumped to the first or last row of the pattern and instead stayed on the current row if it was close to the start / end than a beat / measure (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7374.0).
    - [Fix] <js> Transposing a selection didn't refresh the (potentially changed) default volume display if the selection of the last channel didn't contain the volume column.
    - [Fix] <js> Automatically hiding the volume column didn't work for newly-created MODs (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1928).

    Sample tab
    - [New] <js> Added option to slice a sample at grid points instead of cue points, including a keyboard shortcut (http://forum.openmpt.org/index.php?topic=7376.0).
    - [Fix] <js> Since OpenMPT 1.31.14.00, fine adjustment of sustain loop start / end was broken.

    Instrument tab
    - [Fix] <js> Sample Map dialog: Fixed font scaling in the keyboard display when moving the window between screens with different DPI settings.

    IT
    - [Mod] <js> Files are no longer interpreted as ModPlug-made (thus disabling all compatibility settings) just because instrument extensions are found (no such files are currently known to exist in the wild).

    Third-Party Libraries
    - [Imp] Update ancient (v2.3.0), mpg123 (v1.33.3) and unrar(v7.2.1)
