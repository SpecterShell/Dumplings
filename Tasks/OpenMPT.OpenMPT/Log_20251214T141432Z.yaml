    Sample tab
    - [Imp] <js> Shift-clicking the loop start / end spin buttons now moves the loop points finely, instead of snapping to the next self-similar point (tx Platonist).
    - [Fix] <js> Using Shift to move loop or cue points when zoomed into the sample actually accelerated mouse movement, so it was no longer "fine" movement as intended.

    Other formats
    - [Fix] <js> PT36: Some MODs with samples larger than 64k inside PT36 containers were not read correctly (tx AliceLR).

    Stream Export
    - [Fix] <js> Exporting the same module multiple times (or exporting individual instruments / channels) could lead to files differing in length by one sample when using modern tempo mode.

    Misc
    - [Fix] <jh> Fixed crash when saving IT / MPTM files and shutting down OpenMPT on Wine 10.20 and potentially Wine 11.1 (http://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1933).
    - [Fix] <js> MIDI Export: Choosing the percussion channel for an instrument and then keeping "Mapped" mode selected and never manually touching the dropdown menu resulted in wrong MIDI percussion notes to be exported.
