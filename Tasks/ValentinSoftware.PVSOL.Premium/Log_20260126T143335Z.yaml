    The following new features and changes are included:
    - In the circuit diagram, circuit symbols can now also be inserted in front of AC battery systems and electric vehicles (only if the vehicle does not have its own from-grid tariff).
    - In the consumption dialog, the load profiles from measured values are now displayed in groups.
    - When exporting plans, the type of plan is now appended to the file name.
    The following bugs have been fixed:
    - When configuring multiple module areas, no more module areas could be assigned from the second inverter onwards.
    - Crash when loading projects from program version 2025 with solar peak law that were not simulated.
    - Partial crashes on the welcome page when the program was closed.
    - Crash when loading projects with battery systems or electric vehicles if there was more than one group and results were already available.
    - Problems with the load profile ID if there was only one from-grid tariff left in the tariff list.
    - Partial crashes in the dialog for selecting load profiles.
    - Correction of the display of the discharge power of electric vehicles (factor 1000).
    - A payback period of “1 year and 12 months” is now displayed as “2 years”.
    - Crash in short presentation when there were multiple battery system groups with the same battery system product.
    - Crash when the field for the name of an “Additional heat source -> Other heat source” was left blank in thermal systems.
    - In off-grid projects, the battery system was not displayed correctly in the circuit diagram.
    - Crash on the project report page when there were errors (e.g., a bitmap that was too large) in the circuit diagram.
    - Error when calculating savings if electric vehicles were used to cover consumption.
    - Crash in “New Project” when multiple battery system groups were used but the first group was not selected.
    - Problems displaying the design bar for very high power ratings and consumption.
