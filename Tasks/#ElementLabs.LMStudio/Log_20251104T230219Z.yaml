    New in LM Studio 0.3.31:
    - Improve image understanding output quality, especially for OCR tasks
    - Default image attachment size is now 2048px on the longest side for better quality with vision models
      - Can be changed in Settings > Chat > Image Inputs
    - Support for MiniMax M2 tool calling
    - Flash Attention is now enabled by default for CUDA engines
    - New CLI commands to manage engines:
      - lms runtime get
      - lms runtime update
    - Improved macOS 26 compatibility and support
    Build 7
    - Fixed a bug where sometimes the Load Model button was greyed out for large MLX models
    - Set Flash Attention on by default for CUDA engines
    Build 6
    - Added tool use support for MiniMax M2
    - Added better controls for image input size for vision models
    Build 5
    - Update dependencies to support macOS 26
    - Server UX improvements
      - Log v1/chat/completions prompt processing progress to Developer Logs
      - Model-specific v1/chat/completions Developer Logs
      - Log error when JIT model load failed due to guardrails settings
    Build 4
    - Fixed "vision.imageResizeSettings key does not exist" error
    - Added settings for configuring maximum image input dimensions for vision models.
      - Accessible via Settings > Chat > Image Inputs > "Image resize bounds"
      - These settings control the maximum dimensions to which input images are resized before being sent to vision-capable models.
    Build 3
    - Added lms runtime get and lms runtime update CLI commands to manage runtime extensions from the terminal.
      - Run lms runtime -h for more info.
    - Fix issue where sometimes reasoning models' output would start with a plaintext <think> token
    Build 2
    - Increase image resize limits to 1024x1024 for improved image processing performance (superseded: now 2048px)
      - In a future update this will be user configurable (fixed in build 4)
    Build 1
    - [MLX] Fix ValueError: Image features and image tokens do not match for Qwen3 VL Thinking models
    - Fix occasional UI crash when searching models
