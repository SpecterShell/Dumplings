  ReleaseNotes: |-
    0.3.6 - Release Notes
    LM Studio 0.3.6 introduces a Function Calling / Tool Use API through LM Studio's OpenAI compatibility API.
    This means you can use LM Studio with any framework that currently knows how to use OpenAI tools.
    We've also brought up a new and improved LM Studio in-app updater system.
    Tool Calling API (Beta)
    - New API: A drop-in replacement for OpenAI's Function Calling / Tool Use API
      - Supports both llama.cpp and MLX models
      - Supports both streaming and non-streaming
    - Tool use docs are available on: https://lmstudio.ai/docs/advanced/tool-use
    - Use any LLM that supports Tool Use and Function Calling through the OpenAI-like API
      - Qwen, Mistral, and Llama 3.1/3.2 models work well for tool use
    - Included starter code within the in-app code snippets
    - Improved tool call reliability through sampling configuration for both streaming and non-streaming tool use
    New vision input models
    - Added support for Qwen2VL (2B, 7B, 72B) and QVQ (72B) both in GGUF and MLX
    - Added support for .webp images
    - Added image auto resizing for vision models inputs, hardcoded to 500px width while keeping the aspect ratio
    New and improved installer
    - On Windows: you can now choose the installation drive and directory!
    - On all platforms: brand new LM Studio in-app updates system
      - Subscribe to either Stable or Beta updates. Beta updates will arrive more frequently.
        - Note: previously release channels did not work. Now they do.
    - App updates won't redownload 100s of MBs of dependencies that don't change and generally will be much smaller and faster to download.
      - And we've identified areas to make those even smaller
    - Progress bar when downloading in-app updates
    LM Runtimes improvements
    - Improved LM Runtime release system (llama.cpp, MLX, etc)
      - This was in place for a while, but we've automated nearly everything in this process.
    - In-app notifications when new llama.cpp / MLX versions are available to download
      - Will NOT require a full app update

    - Improved error reporting in the server API
    - Pop out the server logs to a new window by pressing cmd / ctrl + shift + J
      - Works while in the chat page too
    - For power users: LM Studio's home directory moved from the historical ~/.cache/lm-studio to the new ~/.lmstudio.
      - This will only take effect for first-time installs.
      - If you already have data in ~/.cache/lm-studio the app will NOT attempt to move it.
