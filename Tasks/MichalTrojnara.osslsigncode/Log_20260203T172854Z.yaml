    CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY
    This release fixes a critical memory corruption vulnerability. A malicious
    attacker could create a signed file, which, when verified with osslsigncode,
    triggers arbitrary code execution. Any previous version of osslsigncode should
    be immediately upgraded if the tool is used for verification of untrusted
    files.
    - fixed a buffer overflow while extracting message digests
      (reported and fixed by Antoni Klajn, Opera)
