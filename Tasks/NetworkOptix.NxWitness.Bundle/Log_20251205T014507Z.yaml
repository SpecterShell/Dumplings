    SUMMARY:
    - Release Notes show changes relative to the latest official Beta (6.0.6.41837).
    BREAKING CHANGES:
    - Support for Ubuntu 18.04 is discontinued.
    - Support for MacOS 11 is discontinued.
    - Support for Raspberry OS 10 is discontinued.
    - Support for MacOS 12 will be discontinued in the next major release (6.2).
    TERM CHANGES
    - The term "System" is renamed to "Site". This change will be applied across all products (VMS, Cloud, Mobile, Connect).
    NEW DEVICES / OPERATING SYSTEMS SUPPORT:
    - Raspberry Pi 5 with Raspberry Pi OS 12 (64-bit) is supported. Raspberry Pi Native camera is not fully supported yet.
    - Windows Server 2025 is now supported.
    NEW FEATURES:
    - Enterprise (SaaS) - Organization users can be managed in the Desktop Client.
    - Enterprise (SaaS) users can share the links to archive fragments: select the video fragment on Timeline and get the link to share, Links may have expiration date.
    - Enterprise (SaaS) - Re-streaming traffic between Sites. This feature allows adding streams from Sites that belong to different Organizations to be able to view and process them (i.e. grab a stream for analytic purposes, provide links for other organizations, etc).
    - New Event Rules Engine with a cleaner, more user-friendly interface:
      - Event parameters can be passed to actions when events occur (i.e. parameters of analytic objects, date/time of the event occurred, information about the devices triggered etc). Such parameters can be dynamic. This will allow displaying additional information when triggering actions such as: notifications, HTTP requests etc.
      - Lists are introduced (action can be triggered if certain parameter values are listed or missing).
      - In the Event Rules dialog it is possible to perform a search by a trigger name to find a corresponding rule.
      - Event Rule emails are localized.
      - Bearer and Digest Authentication are added to the "Do HTTP request" action in the rules engine.
      - Custom headers can now be configured for the "Do http request".
      - The generic HTTP action now has the option to send the request back to a Server within the Site.
    - The "Shock Alarm" event is now instant instead of prolonged.
    - The Desktop Client is rendered with Direct3D on Windows OS. This will resolve different issues related to OpenGL rendering (i.e. missing / outdated / buggy OpenGL drivers, GPU switching etc).
    - The new Live View Subscription Service is introduced:
      - It allows viewing of Live streams in Enterprise / SaaS sites without interruptions.
      - Every 10 minutes, the live stream from the camera is interrupted for 30 seconds if there is not enough Live View or Recording licences or services purchased.
    - Remote Access is implemented. It will allow providing support engineers with remote access to the site servers via remote access software (SSH, RDP etc) without additional port-forwarding.
    - The separate Audio Playback permission is introduced.
    - The Desktop Client can open up web pages in a separate widget which can interact with the other parts of the Desktop Client UI: open video streams, get analytics data etc. This will improve user experience when using Maps.
    - WebRTC streams (mostly used by Android-powered cameras) can be added to Server.
    - Servers can use Intel or NVidia GPU to perform hardware decoding (for motion detection, for instance). This can be configured independently on each Server in the Server Settings dialog.
    IMPROVEMENTS:
    - Enterprise Improvements:
      - Maps are added as a default integration for all Enterprise users.
      - Added a warning about license conversion when a Site is being merged into an Organization.
      - User Management improved to support adding custom site level permissions to Enterprise users (Channel Partners and Organizations).
      - For Enterprise Sites, if no custom SMTP server is set up, the Emails from VMS are routed via Cloud Email server by default.
      - Channel Partner users are shown in the Event Rules dialog.
      - If a Site is a part of an Organization, this organization is listed as an owner in the Welcome Screen.
      - The "All Systems" filter in the Notifications panel is replaced by"".
    - I/O Port status is being monitored.
    - Cloud Connectivity is being monitored by Servers. The new “Cloud Connect Issue” event is introduced for this purpose.
    - Onvif Profile G has been introduced for the following cameras:
      - Hanwha XND-C9083RV
      - Vivotek FD/IB9391-EHTV-v2 or FD/IB9365-EHTV-v2 series
      - Uniview IPC2325SB-DZK-I0
      - Hikvision and Axis devices are still NOT supported yet.
    - New Server recording modes have been introduced for storage. This will allow using same NAS by multiple Servers and will simplify transferring the archive by swapping hard drives:
      - Exclusive – Server reads, writes and erases data from all folders (default for local storage).
      - Shared – reads all folders, but writes and erases data from its own folder.
      - Isolated – reads, writes and erases data from its own folder (default for non-local storage).
    - Cross-Site Layout improvements:
      - Objects Search (only a “Single device” mode) can be performed on the right panel for the Cross-Site Layouts.
      - Cross-Site Layout intro window is removed.
      - On Cross-Site Layouts, objects on the right panel can be filtered by devices “Selected camera - ” and “Selected camera - none”.
      - Web pages and local files are supported on Cross-Site layouts.
      - 2-Way Audio items are supported on Cross-Site layouts.
    - Similar to devices, layouts can now be grouped in folders in the Resource Tree.
    - Layout improvements:
      - Layout items with sound only (i.e. Speakers) now display a histogram illustrating the sound played.
      - Layout items have individual toggle Mute buttons in addition to the global Mute button on the Timeline.
      - Shared layouts can be used as targets for camera hotspots.
      - The notification filter is moved from the Desktop Client local settings directly to the notifications tab in the right panel.
      - If a default Desktop Client background was set for an OEM, users could not restore it after disabling. Now, the option to use default background is introduced.
      - SVG images can now be set as layout backgrounds.
    - Cloud user session time can be limited.
    - The desktop camera is initialized only when Push My Screen is used for the first time. This optimizes the Client-Server communication.
    - The ability to follow objects of interest with Camera Hotspots and Camera Linking is improved: layouts or multiple items can be opened.
    - The "Connect to server" dialog is redesigned: intro video was removed.
    - Rule author is now shown as the requester of the HTTP action in the Audit Trail.
    - The bookmark tooltips are redesigned to show more information (tags and descriptions).
    - The "Disconnect from Cloud" dialog was improved - it gives much more information about what will happen with the existing services.
    - In multi-Server environments, if a Server acts as a gateway for Client connections, the live stream data is cached, which improves the playback performance.
    - The "Send Mobile Notification" action is improved and shows more info in push notifications.
    - Push notification details now include Site name and Server information.
    - The log settings dialog was improved.
    - Before, the Resource tree showed the current recording status while camera items showed current recording mode according to the schedule. Now, to avoid confusion, both resource tree and camera items display current recording and archive status.
    - Server name or IP is now displayed on the Audit Trail window, so users can find out the server the event happened on.
    - A local Desktop Client setting is introduced (Look and Feel), that will display the current time on live videos.
    - The information about the user triggered a Soft Trigger event, is stored in the Event Log.
    - New resources metrics are added to Health monitoring: device MAC address and Server ID.
    - The playback speed is now saved when clicking play-pause.
    - Added new advanced setting to auto-refresh a Web page opened within the Desktop Client.
    - Bookmark search now correctly handles bookmarks with spaces.
    - Tooltips are implemented for groups in the Resource Tree.
    - Timeline tooltips with Live Preview are available on Linux.
    - Improved time synchronization between live streams if viewing multiple of them on a layout.
    - Log rotation starts automatically if there is less than the certain amount of free on the system disk (1GB by default).
