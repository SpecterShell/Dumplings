    - Updated to .NET 4.8
    - Fixed a crash when switching between desktop and tablet mode.
    - Fixed an issue with authentication involving popup windows.
    - Fixed an alignment issue when switching to full-screen mode in a Genesys Cloud video call.
    - Fixed an issue with the installer not overwriting some files causing a white screen issue on launch.
    Note for administrators using the convenience MSI installer file. The prerequisites for the Genesys Cloud Windows application changed with this update. These prerequisites must be installed before the application is updated. .NET Framework 4.8 and Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable runtime version of at least 14.38.33135 must be installed. These are installed automatically, if necessary, by the EXE installer provided but the MSI file doesn’t have this ability.
