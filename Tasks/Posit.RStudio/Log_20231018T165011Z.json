      "Value": "Deprecated / Removed\nPosit Workbench\n- We have removed support for decrypting or providing encrypted database passwords for the internal PostgreSQL database. Instead, we now strongly recommend a more robust authentication mechanism, such as SSL certificate-based authentication. When a password appears to be encrypted, Workbench will log a warning, and attempt to use it as an unencrypted password. For more information please see the Posit Workbench admin guide section on PostgreSQL.\nNew\nRStudio\n- GitHub Copilot is available as an opt-in integration with RStudio. This feature is currently in public Preview, and has only been tested on RStudio Desktop. Copilot support is expected to be generally available in RStudio Desktop, RStudio Server and Posit Workbench in a future release.\n- Update to Electron 26.2.4 (#13457)\n- Upgrade Node to 16.20.2 (rstudio-pro#5275)\nPosit Workbench\nFixed\nRStudio\n- Fixed a bug where project options updated in the Project Options pane were not properly persisted in RStudio 2023.09.0 (#13757)\n- Fixed issue preventing enabling screen reader mode (#13710)\nPosit Workbench\n- Exclude unused files from the Workbench VS Code Extension package\n- Fixed issue that caused start up crash in environments with encrypted database passwords.
