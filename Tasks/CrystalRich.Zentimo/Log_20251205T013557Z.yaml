    This version includes improved support of High DPI screens, bug fix and lots of minor UI improvements.

    Improved High DPI support
    Previous versions supported screen scaling. But once you set DPI above 150%, the interface started to look weird because they didn’t scale icons with the rest of the UI.
    In the new version, this issue has been fixed, and the program now fully supports even the highest-DPI monitors
    If you have Windows display scaling enabled for the program, don’t forget to turn it off. To do this, right-click the program’s shortcut, select “Properties”, go to the “Compatibility” tab, and click “Change High DPI settings” button. In the opened dialog uncheck all the boxes. Show more

    Bug fix
    - The device menu could overlap other dialogs called from it (Options, Device Properties etc)
    - Disabled devices disappeared from the system after you delete the program settings
    Improvements
    - No more notifications while the system is in full-screen mode (e.g. playing a game, watching movie etc)
    - Default hotkey to call device menu changed from Ctrl+Shift+S to Ctrl+Win+G  (Because the previous key combination is used in many programs as the “Save As” action)
    - Many other minor GUI improvements
    How to update from the previous version?
    Just download and install the required installer over the previous version. You do not need to uninstall the previous version. If your license upgrade period is over, feel free to purchase the renewal.
