    Hello!
    This update to Video AI brings a small but important update to align with our latest company changes. While this release represents a significant shift for all our users, we’re excited about the future and what’s ahead.
    This marks the final major version of Video AI, and we’re committed to carrying its legacy forward with our new Studio release. Video AI will continue to receive occasional minor patch updates, but new AI models and major features will be introduced in the Studio versions of our desktop apps.
    “Topaz Video” will refer to this new application which will be available through a subscription license, and it can be installed alongside Video AI (perpetual license).
    We’ll be discussing more updates to the products with the Studio release, but for now if you have questions about the transition please post them here.
    Thank you!
    Dakota Wixom
    Director of Product
