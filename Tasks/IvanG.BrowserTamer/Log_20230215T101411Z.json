You can disable that in settings, but I'm not sure why you would do that'.\nImprovements:\n+ Browser uptime is displayed as a part of browser stats\n+ Browser profile overlays in the picker are rounded similar to how Chromium paints them.\n+ Multi-window interface\nBugs Fixed:\n- Change Log was trimming older entries so you couldn't see them at all.\n- Picker Enabled setting was always ignored and picker was shown regardless\n- Uninstaller completely removes all traces of BT from the system"
