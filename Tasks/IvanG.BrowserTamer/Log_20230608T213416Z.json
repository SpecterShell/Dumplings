      "Value": "New Features:\n! Custom browser's profiles are now just custom browsers, making custom-registered browser experience more ergonomic. They can be added from File menu.\n! Metrics window is completely removed. I've decided this app should do one thing but do it well and metrics is just outside of the scope of Browser Tamer core functionality. There are plenty of tools to investigate performance, including ones built into Windows itself.\n! File menu has new option - 'copy path to config.ini' which copies it to clipboard.\nImprovements:\n+ Browser list in config window is sorted - system browsers alphabetically, then custom browsers alphabetically. Profiles are sorted alphabetically to, incognito being at the end. All of the sorting is case-insensitive.\n+ Freed up configuration real estate by moving 'test' button to the rest of browser control buttons.\n+ Window scaling errors fixed for certain monitors.\n+ Config window status bar text doesn't jump around when width change.\n+ All of the browsers have a running icon indicator, including user-defined.\nBugs Fixed:\n- If custom defined browser didn't specify url argument nothing was passed to the target browser"
