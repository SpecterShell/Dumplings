    - A Deselect All button has been added which deselects all passages.
    - Doing a search and replace that would cause a passage name conflict (e.g. replacing "a" with "b" in a story with passages named "1a" and "1b") is now blocked by the application.
    - Entering an invalid regular expression in the Find and Replace dialog now shows an error message.
    - The collapse/expand button in dialogs has been moved to the right side, next to the maximize and close buttons.
    - Colors in the application have been recalibrated to use consistent brightness.
    - The icons for the maximize button in dialogs have changed.
