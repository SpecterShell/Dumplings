    - Java 21 LTS Support: TestEngine now supports Java 21 LTS.
    - SLM Licensing and Data-Driven Tests (TSERV-2261 and TSERV-2288): Fixed an issue introduced in version 1.34.0 that prevented SLM licenses from running data-driven tests after the removal of file-based licensing. Data-driven tests now execute as expected with SLM licenses.
