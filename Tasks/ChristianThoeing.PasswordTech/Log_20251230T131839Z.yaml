    IMPORTANT NOTE As of version 3.5.10, Password Tech no longer supports 32-bit
    versions of Windows. Only 64-bit builds will officially be provided. If you're
    still using a 32-bit version of Windows, for which support by Microsoft has
    ended in October 2025, I strongly recommend updating to Windows 11 at your
    earliest convenience.
    New Features
    - PassCube: Database settings: New option "Master password expires" allows
      setting an expiry date for the master password; when opening the database,
      user will be warned if the master password has expired or will expire soon
    Changes & Improvements
    - Password database: As of database version 1.7, master password and recovery
      passwords are encoded as UTF-8; databases created with older versions (with
      UTF-16 encoding) will be updated to UTF-8 when changing master/recovery
      password; note that databases with UTF-8 password encoding are no longer
      compatible with older program versions (< 3.5.10)
    - Perform multiple attempts to clear clipboard when data cannot be accessed
      immediately
