    Added
    - Support for {Future,Stream}Any in the component model has improved. #12142
    - Wasmtime has initial support for breakpoints and single-stepping with the debug feature for guest programs. #12133
    - Wasmtime has begun adding a new Error type which is similar to anyhow::Error but supports gracefully handling OOM. Wasmtime still uses anyhow::Error but this will change in the future to wasmtime::Error which will be a distinct type. #12163
    - An initial top-level crate for async-debugging guest programs has been added. #12183
    Changed
    - Cranelift now optimizes redundant select + icmp instructions. #12135
    - Synchronous component model functions can no longer block before returning. This implements a change in the upstream specification to the upcoming async support in the component model which places stricter restrictions on non-async functions and their ability to perform blocking operations. #12043
    - Frame iteration in debug mode now visits all activations which enables seeing all frames from recursive wasm calls. #12176
    - Wasmtime now requires Rust 1.90.0 or later. #12167
    - Intra-component stream/future reads/writes are now allowed for simple data types. #12181
    - The POLL callback code has been removed from the canonical ABI for async functions and the waitable-set.poll function no longer yields. #12182
    - Guest-to-guest adapters injected by Wasmtime now have improved trapping error messages. #12215
    Fixed
    - #[derive(Lift)] for enums with exactly 256 cases has been fixed. #12140
    - With component-model-async support recursively calling a guest from a host function has now been fixed. #12152
