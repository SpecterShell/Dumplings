    This update introduces a new, secure sign-in process using Azure. All users - new and existing - will need to create a new account. Registration is quick and intuitive, and youâ€™ll only need to sign in once every 90 days.
    Please note: Your previous credentials (license key, password, security questions) will no longer work after this update. No project data will be lost - only the sign-in method is changing. Make sure you are connected to the internet before updating.
    Click "Download" to download the latest version and begin the new registration process.
