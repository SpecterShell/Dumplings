    - Improved Client support for DNS options
      - Client implementations for Linux/BSD/macOS, included with the default install
      - New client implementation for Windows, adding support for features like split DNS and DNSSEC
    - Architectural improvements on Windows
      - The block-local flag is now enforced with WFP filters
      - Windows network adapters are now generated on demand
      - Windows automatic service now runs as an unpriviledged user
      - Support for server mode in win-dco driver

    - Improved data channel
      - Enforcement of AES-GCM usage limit
      - Epoch data keys and packet format
    - Support for new upstream DCO Linux kernel module

    - Client-side support for new PUSH_UPDATE control-channel message
      - This allows servers to send updates to options like routing and DNS config without triggering a reconnect.
    - PUSH_UPDATE server support (minimal)
      - New management interface commands push-update-broad and push-update-cid to send PUSH_UPDATE option updates.
    - TLS 1.3 support with bleeding-edge mbedTLS versions
    - Support for mbedTLS version 4
    - Two new environment variables have been introduced to communicate desired default gateway redirection to plugins like Network Manager.
    - Support for Epoch data channel on Windows, using the win-dco driver (2.8.0+)
    - "Recursive Routing" check is now more granular, and will only drop packets-in-tunnel if destination IP, protocol and port matches with those needed to reach the VPN server.
