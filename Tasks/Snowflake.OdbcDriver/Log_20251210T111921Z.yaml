    New features and updates
    - Added support for Decfloat types.
    - Support cross-signed chains during OCSP check.
    - Implemented a new CRL (Certificate Revocation List) checking mechanism.
      Enabling CRLs improves security by checking for revoked certificates during the TLS handshake process. For more information, see the Replacing OCSP with CRL as the method of certificate revocation checking Knowledge Base article.
      This feature is disabled by default. For information on enabling this feature, see Certificate revocation list (CRL) options. Snowflake recommends that you test this feature before enabling it in production.
    Bug fixes
    - Removed the trailing null termination character from the JWT header and payload.
