    What’s new in Camera Hub 2.0?
    We’re hyped to unveil the latest Camera Hub update and deliver improvements across the board. Add cinematic color grading with LUTs, let Voice Sync scroll in even more languages, and download backgrounds in one click with Marketplace. Let’s dive in.

    🎨 Cinematic color with LUTs
    Camera Hub now supports Look-Up Tables (LUTs) for professional-grade color tuning. A first for webcam software, you now have direct access to LUTs and community-created filters.
    To get started, select a LUT in the Effects tab, then open your app—OBS Studio, Zoom, etc.—and select “Elgato Virtual Camera” as your video device.
    Find your look on Marketplace

    👆 1-click installation with Marketplace integration
    Elgato Marketplace is built right into Camera Hub, making it easier than ever to browse and install virtual backgrounds and LUTs. Just log in from the top-right menu, and you’re in.
