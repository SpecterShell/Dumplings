    New features and enhancements
    - all programs: added a command-line parameter --no-bom that disables writing byte order marks to text files encoded with one of the UTF variants. Implements #6166.
    - MKVToolNix GUI: multiplexer: added variable <MTX_CHAPTERS_FILE_NAME> to the "run program after job completion" mechanism containing the absolute path to the chapters file name. Implements #6172.

    Bug fixes
    - mkvmerge: OBU reader: fixed probing files in which the first frame ends after the 1MB mark, which is how big the memory buffer used for probing content is. Fixes #6165.
    - mkvmerge: VobSub reader: VobSub .idx files that start with a byte-order mark (BOM) are now read again correctly. Fixes #6162.
    - mkvextract: AV1/IVF: fixed inserting a temporal delimiter OBU at the start of each frame if there is none. Mostly fixes #6120.
    - mkvextract: AV1/IVF: fixed a potential calculation error when deriving frame rate numerator & denominator from Matroska's default duration. Part of the fix of #6120.
    - mkvextract: AV1/IVF: fixed calculation of IVF frame number calculation from Matroska's frame timestamps by rounding instead of truncating. Part of the fix of #6120.
