      "Value": "New features and enhancements\n- MKVToolNix GUI: if the system's locale uses one of the Han scripts, the GUI will force Arabic numerals to be used in spin boxes. This prevents Suzhou numerals from being used which seems to be the default on Windows systems sold in China. Implements #3624.\n\nBug fixes\n- build system: fixed detection of Qt6 if clang is used for compilation on Linux. In that case Qt's qmake added a gcc-specific option that clang doesn't understand, -mno-direct-extern-access. configure will now pass the parameter -spec linux-clang to qmake so that it uses the correct compiler flags.\n- build system: fixed the use of mktemp to be more portable to e.g. macOS. Fixes #3608.\n- mkvmerge: if a video aspect ratio was given with --aspect-ratio-factor, the code would apply a second factor based on the pixel resolution, resulting in much too large values for the DisplayWidth element. For example, with a pixel resolution of 720x520 & an aspect ratio factor of 1/1 the result should be 720x520, but instead it was 900x520. Up until release 76.0 this has only happened when a track order was given (which unfortunately includes all invocations with MKVToolNix GUI as it always includes the track order). Starting with release 77.0 this has always happened due to the automatic sorting of tracks implicitly creating a track order, even if none was given."
