    We're thrilled to launch LobeHub - the ultimate space for work and life: to find, build, and collaborate with agent teammates that grow with you.
    What new in the release?
    - Multi-Agent Collaboration: Bring multiple specialized agents into one conversation. They debate, reason, and solve complex problems together—faster and smarter.

    - Pages: write, read and organize documents with Lobe AI
    - Memory: Your agents remember your preferences, style, goals, and past projects—delivering uniquely personalized assistance that gets better over time.
    - New Knowledge Base: Use folders to organize your knowledge & resource
    - Marketplace: Publish, adopt, or remix agents in a thriving community where intelligence grows together.
    - And even more
