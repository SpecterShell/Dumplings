    📝 Additional Information
    Summary by Sourcery
    Scope agent evaluation benchmarks and new bot provider bindings by user while introducing infrastructure for external chat platform integrations.
    New Features:
    - Add agent bot provider database schema and model to store per-agent external platform bindings with encrypted credentials.
    - Introduce agent agency configuration types and persist agencyConfig on agents for Discord and Slack bot settings.
    Bug Fixes:
    - Associate agent evaluation benchmarks with a userId and restrict create, query, update, delete, and lookup operations to the owning user while still allowing access to system benchmarks.
    Enhancements:
    - Export new agentBotProvider schema and agency configuration types through existing database and type index barrels.
    Tests:
    - Extend agent evaluation benchmark model tests to cover user-scoped behavior, including isolation between different users and handling of system benchmarks.
