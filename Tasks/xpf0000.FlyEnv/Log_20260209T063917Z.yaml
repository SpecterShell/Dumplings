    FlyEnv Update Release Notes
    🚀 New Features
    1. Language Support: Added Zig Module
    Implemented based on the feature request by @timint.
    Reference: Issue #507

    2. Database Support: Added Qdrant Module
    In response to numerous user requests for vector database support in FlyEnv, we have officially added the Qdrant module. Stay tuned, as more vector databases will be integrated in future updates.

    🛠️ Improvements & Optimizations
    3. Enhanced Application Update Workflow
    We’ve redesigned the update process to give you full control. Previously, updates were applied without a prior preview of changes. Starting with this version, you can view the full changelog before deciding whether to proceed with the update.
    4. True Portability for Windows Portable Version
    We have resolved the data isolation issue in the Windows portable version. User data is now stored alongside the executable program, making FlyEnv fully portable. You can now run it directly from a USB drive or mobile hard disk without losing your settings or data.
    5. Helper Improvements & System Stability
    - Optimized the helper program to enhance overall system stability.
    - Windows: Improved the helper installation method and fixed issues where the installation would previously fail.
