    1. Optimize FlyEnv Helper logic: trigger installation prompts only when necessary.

    In this video, I noticed that sometimes users are unclear whether the PHP version used by their site is running properly. Therefore, a display of the PHP running status has been added to the site interface. This allows users to clearly see whether the PHP version used by their site is currently running.
