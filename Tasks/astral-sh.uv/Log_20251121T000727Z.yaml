    Released on 2025-11-20.
    Due to rate limiting during publish to crates.io, this release was partially published and manually finished. Consequently, crates.io does not include all of the artifacts and the GitHub Release was published by a maintainer instead of GitHub Actions. The artifacts from GitHub Actions were used without alteration. There should be no consequences from this; we just want to be transparent about the provenance of the artifacts.
