    Changelog
    GUI and Functionality
    - Fix a bug where the preferences window would allow arbitrary tab sizes. Now,
      tab sizes are bound between 2 and 10 (see #6131).
    - Fixed links not registering clicks when they are pre-rendered within table
      cells of the TableEditor (#4557).
    - Fix application of custom tag classes.
    - Fixed a bug that would not correctly apply the code class to segments of
      code in some circumstances (primarily when adding YAML front matters or
      comments).
    - Fix syntax highlighting in code blocks, frontmatters, etc. Now, Zettlr assigns
      more default-colors of the solarized code syntax theme. In addition, regular
      text is now more readable, especially in light mode.
    - Fixes and improvements to the toolbar styling; simplify CSS rules.
    - Made toolbar icons slightly larger.
    - Update ja-JP translation (#6132).
    - Fixed a bug that would not accept custom height constraints via Pandoc
      attributes for images if the maximum image height was set to 100% in the
      settings.
    - Fixed "Learn more" link on the citation page in the onboarding window (#6138).
    - Fixed an issue that would make the file search crash on Windows, if a
      workspace was located at a volume root (#6142).
    - Fixed an issue that would cause Mermaid graphs to still be pre-rendered in
      "raw" mode (#6141).
    - Fixed a bug that would cause code files (JSON/YAML/TeX) to be formatted
      weirdly if Zettlr opens with one of these files on startup, due to relevant
      CSS never being loaded in this case.
    - Improved PDF viewer interaction (#6153).
    Under the Hood
    - Update dependencies:
      - Electron: v40.0
      - Forge: 7.11.1
      - Builder: 26.5.0
    - The FSAL Cache now consistently utilizes asynchronous filesystem operations
      (#5994).
    - Refactor Zettelkasten link and tag parsing (#5997).
    - Number controls in forms now allow for providing min and max values.
    - Increased strictness of the @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any rule from
      "off" (no checking) to "warn" to slowly start migrating away from any
      remaining any uses in the wild.
    - FSAL Improvements:
      - Removed a lot of dead code in the FSAL.
      - Moved the save functionality away from the FSAL*-submodules, and divided
        the responsibility between the DocumentsProvider and the FSAL module.
