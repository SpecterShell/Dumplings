    Changed:
    - Drop support for 3.9

    Added:
    - Support for workspaces inspired by Cargo Workspaces
    - Dependency group support.
    - The version and project metadata commands now support projects that do not use Hatchling as the build backend
    - The version command accepts a --force option, allowing for downgrades when an explicit version number is given.
    - Build environments can now be configured, the default build environment is hatch-build
    - The environment interface now has the following methods and properties in order to better support builds on remote machines: project_root, sep, pathsep, fs_context
    - Bump the minimum supported version of packaging to 24.2
    - Upgrade Ruff to 0.13.2
    Fixed:
    - All HTTP requests now set an identifiable User-Agent header.
