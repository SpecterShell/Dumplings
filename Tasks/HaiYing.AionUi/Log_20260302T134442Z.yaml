    New Features
    1. aionui:// deep link protocol
    Support for the aionui:// URL scheme to pre-fill New-API provider settings, so external links can open AionUi with API config pre-filled.
    2. Keyboard shortcuts for confirmation prompts
    Confirmation dialogs now support keyboard shortcuts so you can confirm or cancel quickly from the keyboard.
    3. Slash commands and WebUI dev-mode proxy
    Slash commands are implemented and supported in the chat interface.
    WebUI dev-mode proxy is available so slash commands work when developing against the WebUI server.
