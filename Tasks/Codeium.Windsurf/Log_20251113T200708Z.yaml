    GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.1-Codex
    GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.1-Codex are now available in Windsurf. GPT-5.1 will become the default model in Windsurf for one week, and paid users get free access during this period.
    GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.1-Codex deliver a solid upgrade from GPT-5 for agentic coding workflows. They're noticeably better at understanding what you're asking for and working with you to get it done. The new variable thinking feature dynamically adjusts reasoning depth—providing quick responses for simple tasks and more thoughtful analysis when complexity demands it.
