    Wave 13: Merry Shipmas
    Wave 13 brings first-class support for parallel, multi-agent sessions in Windsurf, along with Git worktrees, side-by-side Cascade panes, and a dedicated terminal profile for more reliable agent execution.

    SWE-1.5 Free
    Our near-frontier model, SWE-1.5, is now available for free to all users for the next 3 months. SWE-1.5 Free has the full intelligence of SWE-1.5, with the same coding performance on SWE-Bench-Pro, but delivered at standard throughput speeds. The original variant of SWE-1.5 hosted on Cerebras will continue to be available for paid users. SWE-1.5 Free will replace SWE-1 as the default model in Windsurf starting today.

    Git Worktree Support
    Windsurf now supports Git worktrees, letting you spawn multiple Cascade sessions in the same repository without conflicts. Git worktrees check out different branches into separate directories while sharing the same Git history.

    Multi-Cascade Panes & Tabs
    You can already run multiple Cascade sessions in Windsurf at the same time. Now, you can view and interact with them in separate panes and tabs within the same window. This lets you monitor progress and compare outputs of sessions side-by-side, or even turn Windsurf into a big Cascade dashboard.

    Cascade Dedicated Terminal (Beta)
    Windsurf introduces a new approach for letting agents execute terminal commands. Instead of your default shell, Cascade will now run commands in a dedicated zsh shell specifically configured for reliability. The Cascade Dedicated Terminal can use the environment variables you set in your .zshrc configuration and is interactive, which means you can answer any prompts from shell scripts without having to break your flow. This should improve the reliability and speed of shell commands, especially for users with complicated prompts (e.g., powerlevel10k).
    In this version, the Cascade Dedicated Terminal will be opt-in for Windsurf Stable on macOS. If you are experiencing issues with the older legacy terminal, we recommend switching to the new terminal early. We expect to make this feature the default in the future, while maintaining the legacy terminal extension for backwards compatibility purposes. You can opt-in in the Windsurf User Settings -> Disable Windsurf Legacy Terminal Profile.

    Context Window Indicator
    When a model's context window grows too long, earlier context can be dropped without warning and performance can degrade. Cascade already extends the window by occasionally summarizing messages and clearing history. This release adds a visual indicator to see how much of your context window is currently in use, helping you anticipate limits and decide when to start a new session.

    Cascade Hooks
    Execute custom commands at key points during Cascade's workflow, including on model response for auditing purposes.

    System-level Rules & Workflows
    Enterprises can deploy rules and workflows via MDM policies, allowing organizations to place rules and workflows files on users' machines.

    Bug Fixes and Improvements
    - Enhanced diff zone behavior with configurable scroll-to-next-hunk settings (default off)
    - Preserved colors and styling in Cascade terminal output
    - Multiple fixes to the Model Context Protocol implementation
    - Supports lowering permissions for Cascade's Web Fetch tool
    - Fix race condition in the dedicated terminal implementation
    - Support force killing commands in the dedicated terminal
    - Improved markdown completion
    - Fix opening old Cascade diffs
