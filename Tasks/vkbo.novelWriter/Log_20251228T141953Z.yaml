    Release Notes
    This is a patch release that fixes an issue where the application could crash due to a change in PyQt/Qt 6.10. The issue is related to certain input methods, and is at least triggered when using Spotlight on MacOS.
    Detailed Changelog
    Bugfixes
    - Fix an issue where the inputMethodQuery call to the Qt library returns an object that PyQt6 cannot convert to a Python object. The fix just disables the conversion since the return value is passed back to the Qt library anyway. The problem affects Qt/PyQt 6.10 and is triggered in MacOS at least, but it is not known if it affects other platforms. Issue #2622. PR #2623.
    Documentation
    - Removed references to the old colour theme system in the documentation. Issue #2619. PR #2625.
