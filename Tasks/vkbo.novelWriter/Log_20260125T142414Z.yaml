    Bugfixes
    - Fixed an issue with the exe launcher on Windows where it didn't support spaces in the path when the user tried to open novelWriter from a project file. Issue #2643. PR #2645.
    - Fixed an issue with the PDF manuscript format which stopped after about 600-700 pages when generating A4 pages. The limit is now in the 11000 pages range. Issue #2637. PRs #2638 and #2639.
    Improvements
    - Added an alert box when the spell check language selected for a project could not be loaded. Issue #2631. PR #2654.
