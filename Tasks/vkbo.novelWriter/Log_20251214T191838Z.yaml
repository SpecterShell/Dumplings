    Detailed Changelog
    Bugfixes
    - Fix an issue where the app could crash when the user pasted from an empty clipboard. This appears to be a Qt or PyQt bug, and is not present on the later releases, but a fix has been added that ensures the bug is not triggered. Issue #2598. PR #2602.
    Documentation
    - Fixed a broken link in the updated 2.8 docs. PR #2595.
    Internationalisation
    - Updated Czech, German, US English, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian and Chinese translation files from the Crowdin project page. PR #2608.
    Packaging
    - Added qt6-svg-plugins as a direct dependency of novelWriter on Debian. This package was not always installed on some distros. Issue #2604. PR #2607.
