    We’ve just released EmEditor v25.4.2. This update delivers several important fixes and optimizations to keep your experience smooth and stable, so we recommend updating as soon as possible.
    - Added support for GPT-5.1 (the ChatAI plug-in is required).
    - Fixed occasional malfunctions in AI prompts (the ChatAI plug-in is required).
    - Fixed an issue that sometimes caused the status bar’s line/column display to be cut off.
    - Fixed a problem in the Large File Controller when using case-insensitive regular-expression filters.
    - Fixed an issue where the Keyboard page in settings could show an asterisk—as if it had been modified—even when the defaults were unchanged.
    - Fixed unexpected behavior triggered by double-clicking [+] in tree views like the Snippets and CommitList plug-ins.
    - Fixed a crash that could occur in the CommitList plug-in when double-clicking a directory in the Commit List pane after comparing commits.
    - Fixed a bug where undo could stop working after making a few box selections under low-memory conditions.
    - Adjusted the position of the balloon notification when opening EmEditor with a very large file.
    - Fixed an issue that made Find in Files extremely slow when symbolic links or junctions were involved.
    - Improved performance across multiple areas, including file opening, Find in Files, and horizontal scrolling on very long lines.
