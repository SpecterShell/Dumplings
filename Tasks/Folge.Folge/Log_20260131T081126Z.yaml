    🎉 This is the 60th release of Folge! Almost 6 years ago, in April 2020, I released the first version of Folge. Since then, every feature, every improvement, and every bug fix has been shaped by feedback from users like you. Your suggestions, bug reports, and kind words have kept me motivated through countless late nights and weekend coding sessions. Thank you for being part of this journey. I'm excited to keep making Folge better for years to come.
    🎁 New Features
    - Word Export Page Sizes – Word exports now support multiple page sizes including A3, A5, Legal, and Letter formats.
    - Per-Format Export Locations – Export locations are now stored separately for each format, so your PDF exports go to one folder while Word exports go to another.
    - Redesigned Bulk Actions Menu – The bulk actions menu in the Guides list has been completely redesigned for better usability.
    - Preview Steps Button – Added a Preview Steps button to the right sidebar for quick step previews without leaving the editor.
    - Simple Screenshot Memory – Simple screenshot mode now remembers your previous coordinates and timer settings.
