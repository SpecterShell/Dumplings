    We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Help+Manual 10.1.0! This update is particularly interesting if you want to use the ChatGPT plugin with custom LLMs.
    ChatGPT Plugin
    We fixed a proxy bug with the ChatGPT plugin: the plugin did not use the proxy defined for Help+Manual in general. With this update, ChatGPT uses the global proxy by default and lets you set custom proxy settings in the plugin directly.

    Help+Manual 10.1.0 Miscellaneous Changes
    - Paste picture from clipboard: the save dialog that lets you specify the file name for the picture now uses the extended version, so you can directly add an image style, caption, zoom, etc.
    - Insert Variable: the dialog now features a recently used list with the last 7 variables inserted, making variables easier to insert
    - eViewer 5.6 included
    - SnipSVG 2.1 included
    - PDF snippets in PDF export: when a “raw PDF snippet” was the very first item in a topic, the snippet was not printed.
    - Word/DOCX export: Cyrillic characters in style names were not exported correctly on a Russian Windows.
    - Webhelp Export on Chinese Windows versions: UTF8-BOM for topic pages was wrong encoded.
    All updates are available from our download page.
