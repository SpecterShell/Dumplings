    Release 0.9.12 (Final 0.9.x Series)
    [!NOTE]
    This is a quick release before marking the end of 0.9.x series due to breaking changes introduced by the work in #533
    Fixes & Improvements
    - Modal rendering now fills the entire git, bookmarks, and custom command dialogs before drawing rows, eliminating gaps introduced by the new renderer #535
    - Fixed a regression where ui.colors.selected = { bg = "black" } no longer highlighted the selected revision by restoring the correct lipgloss → ANSI color conversion #534
    - jj git fetch --tracked uses the t shortcut so f remains dedicated to the default fetch, matching the push command’s tracked shortcut #532
    - Added a [keys.diff_view] config section so diff scrolling, paging, and closing bindings are customizable #527
    - Completion now auto-inserts () when selecting a parameterless function, improving Lua/script authoring speed #530
    - Lua’s flash() accepts error and sticky fields, so scripts can show error toasts and control persistence without additional helpers #529
