    What's fixed:
    - We've restored the Run button in run/debug configurations of the type JavaScript Debug (WEB-73293).
    - We've fixed a NoSuchElementException: Key 10 is missing in the map exception (IJPL-204027).
    - We've fixed a problem with true being always returned by TerminalUtil.hasRunningCommands in the Terminal on WSL, so Copilot no longer awaits endlessly for command execution (IJPL-213951).
    - A confirmation dialog is now shown on attempting to close the Reworked Terminal on WSL (IJPL-192177).
    - The New Tab and New Predefined Session buttons no longer disappear from the Terminal with the GitHub Copilot plugin enabled (IJPL-219664).
    - We've fixed the appearance of tool window stripes, so they are shown with correct background color when a tool window icon is dragged (IJPL-223262).
    - We've updated MCP SDK to 0.8.1 (IJPL-221739).
    - We've fixed a deadlock that occurred in the Confirm Save Document dialog (IJPL-214611).
