    What's fixed:
    - We've fixed a problem with idea.max.intellisense.filesize being ignored in the Remote Development mode via Gateway (IJPL-181223).
    - We've introduced a com.intellij.modules.compose plugin alias thus making it possible to provide plugin templates that use Compose for UI (IJPL-213685).
    - We've fixed a problem with the JetBrains Gateway's ramping up CPU after ssh disconnection (IJPL-210626).
    - We've fixed a problem with cleaning up outdated temp properties files in the Remote Development mode (IJPL-204792).
    - We've fixed a problem with the backend being unable to start due to the permission issue with the /tmp/jbrd-fontconfig-* folder on the shared remote host (IJPL-189073).
    For more details, please see the release notes.
