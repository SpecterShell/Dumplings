    - We've fixed navigation to the Manage GitHub accounts dialog (IJPL-229877).

    - The Master Password dialog can now be opened by clicking the Gear icon next to a selected KeePass (IJPL-229417).
    - We've fixed a problem with datasource credentials being considered invalid when they have been updated in the keepassdb without restart (IJPL-4188).
    - We've restored the appearance and behavior of the Services tool window, so no extraneous duplicates of launched run configurations are shown (IJPL-220985).
