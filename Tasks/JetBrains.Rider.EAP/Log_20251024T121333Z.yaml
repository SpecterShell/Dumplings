    Rider 2025.3 EAP 7 comes with the following updates:
    Debugger support for C# 12 Inline Arrays
    Rider's .NET debugger now supports the InlineArray types introduced in C# 12. You can easily view, expand, and inspect inline array elements while debugging, with clear element indexing and value display in the Locals window.
    Faster startup and reduced memory usage
    Project loading is now noticeably faster thanks to workspace model optimizations and lazy loading of project nodes. Rider now loads only essential project data at startup, fetching the rest on demand. These improvements significantly speed up startup and lower memory usage, especially in large solutions.
    For the full list of fixes and improvements, please refer to our issue tracker.
