    Rider 2025.3 EAP 8 is out!
    As we're approaching Rider's next stable release, the bulk of our work on this EAP was dedicated to bug fixes and under-the-hood work.
    Important fixes included:
    The Navigate | File Member action now correctly displays the structure of the current file in C++ projects, instead of showing data from a previously opened file. [RIDER-131674]
    For the full list of fixes and improvements, please refer to our issue tracker.
