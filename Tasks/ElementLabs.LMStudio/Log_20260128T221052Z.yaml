    LM Studio 0.4.0 - Release Notes
    Welcome to LM Studio 0.4.0 👾!
    - We're excited to introduce the next generation of LM Studio.
    - New features include:
      - llmster: the LM Studio Daemon for headless deployments w/o GUI on servers or cloud instances
      - Parallel inference requests (instead of queued) for high throughput use cases
      - New stateful REST API with local MCP server support - POST /v1/chat
      - A completely revamped UI experience ✨
    Build 17
    - MCPs will now only be loaded when needed, instead of at app startup
    - Fixed a bug where some fields in app settings could get reset after update
    Build 16
    - New icons and placements for Discover, My Models buttons
    - Fixed a bug where generators wouldn't show in the top bar model picker when selected
    - Fixed a bug which prevented additional quantizations from being downloaded for staff pick models that were already downloaded
    - Fixed a bug where lms import will sometimes not work properly if it llmster (daemon) is also installed
    - Fixed a bug in /api/v1/chat that caused server errors when inputs were empty or top_k exceeded 500
    - Fixed a bug where lms ls and lms load sometimes would fail after waking up the LM Studio service
    - Fixed a bug where sometimes token counting would not work properly for gpt-oss models
    Build 15
    - Introduce Parallel Requests with Continuous Batching 🚀
      - When loading a model, you can now select n_parallel to allow multiple requests to be processed in parallel.
      - When enabled, instead of queuing requests one by one, the model will process up to N requests simultaneously.
      - By default, parallel slots are set to 4 (with unified KV set to true, which should result in no additional memory overhead).
      - This is supported for LM Studio's llama.cpp engine, with MLX coming later.
    - Introducing Split View in Chat: view two chats side by side.
      - Drag and drop chat tabs to either half of the window to split the view.
      - Close one side of the split view with the 'x' button in the top right of each pane.
    - Introducing 🔧 Developer Mode: a simplification of the previous Developer/Power User/User 3 mode switch.
      - Developer Mode combines the previous Developer and Power User modes into a single mode with all advanced features enabled.
      - You can turn on Developer Mode in Settings > Developer.
    - New setting: enforce allowing only one new empty chat at a time (default: enabled)
      - Change in Settings > Chat
