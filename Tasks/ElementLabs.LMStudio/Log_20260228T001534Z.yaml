    - ✨🎉 Introducing LM Link
      - Connect to remote instances of LM Studio, load your models, and use them as if they were local.
      - End-to-end encrypted. Launching in partnership with Tailscale.
    - Fixed a bug where auto update will sometimes not work due to failing to exit before updater runs.
      - This fix only applies, when updating to the next version. That is, you might still encounter issues as you are updating to 0.4.6+1.
    - Fixed Qwen3.5 RAG jinja rendering bug: "No user query found in messages"
    - Updated go version to 0.25.7 for LM Link.
    - [DGX Spark] Enable Direct I/O to improve model load latency
      - Requires llama.cpp engine 2.5.1 or greater.
RealVersion: 0.4.6+1
