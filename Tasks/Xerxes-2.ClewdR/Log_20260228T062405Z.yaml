    Release Notes
    - Requests now keep the original system content from clients unchanged by default (except existing cache-control scope cleanup).
    - Kept custom_system support: when configured, it is prepended to the request system content.
    - Dropped the system field when it is empty (null, blank string, or empty system block list) before forwarding requests.
