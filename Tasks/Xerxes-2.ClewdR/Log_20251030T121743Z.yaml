    Highlights
    - Claude tool-result content now accepts structured array payloads, keeping MCP clients such as OpenHands compatible with the proxy.
    Improvements
    - Normalized endpoint constants and switched to Url::join when building Claude Code, Claude Web, Gemini, and OAuth URLs, avoiding double-slash mistakes when overriding API hosts.
    - Refined Claude message sanitization so blank assistant turns are dropped without discarding legitimate content blocks.
    Bug Fixes
    - Fixed Claude Code chat and token-count requests failing when the configured endpoint already included a trailing slash.
    Dependency Updates
    - Bumped zip to 6.x and enable-ansi-support to 0.3, refreshing the lockfile to the latest compatible releases.
