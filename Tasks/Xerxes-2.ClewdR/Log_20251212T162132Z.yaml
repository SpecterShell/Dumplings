    Release Notes
    - Improved Claude Code request handling with User-Agent detection (including claude-cli) and a configurable prelude system prompt for non-Claude Code clients.
    - Fixed built-in tool schema handling (including web_search_20250305) to make web search/tooling work reliably.
    - Fixed ANSI color output: disable escape codes when stdout is redirected and in log files; adjusted tracing-subscriber version for correct terminal ANSI behavior.
    - Renamed “NonPro” to “Free” and updated related UI/config messages (e.g. “Skip Free”).
    - Updated dependencies and removed unused helper files/scripts; stopped ignoring .claude via .gitignore.
