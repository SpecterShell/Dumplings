  Value: |-
    - Added glycan visualisations both full structures and fragments, in the spectrum, on peptides, and when searching / displaying modifications
    - Custom models can be saved (and backed up and shared between machines)
    - Added support for a basic CSV file to open as identified peptide (needing 'scan_index', 'z', 'raw_file', 'sequence', and possibly 'mode' as columns)
    - Added support for more complex fragmentation model
      - Added amino acid specific neutral losses to peptide fragments
      - Added side chain losses from peptide fragments
      - Added variant ions, where ions lose or gain hydrogen, z· means z + H, z' means z - H
      - Added control over glycan fragments on peptide fragments
      - Added control to neutral losses of glycan diagnostic ions and immonium ions
      - Added satellite ions distant from the parent breakage, nw indicates a w ion where the nth side chain (starting at 0) from the parent z ion fragments off
    - MS2 annotations are ordered on crude likelihood
    - General bug fixes, amongst others fixed high memory usage on merging spectra
    - Added the manual in the Annotator to make it easy to find
