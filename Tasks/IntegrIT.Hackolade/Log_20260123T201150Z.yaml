    - Polyglot: introduced flexible modeling for relationships, allowing gradual refinement from conceptual to logical phases.  More info at https://hackolade.com/help/ConceptualtoLogicalwithPolyglotr.html
    - Relationships: changed Foreign Master relationship lines from dashed to dotted, so as to leave dashed lines for non-identifying relationships
    - Documentation generation: refactored to dynamically reflect the configuration in the Properties Pane
    - Excel: enabled reverse-engineering in unsaved models when the Excel file does not contain references to other models

    - Collibra: added retry logic if the fetch request runs into error net::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING
    - Avro: ensured appropriate name validation after derivation from Polyglot
    - BigQuery: added support for choice of file granularity when generating DDLs: per model, per schema, or per table
    - BigQuery: added support for defining Unique and Alternate Keys (Natural Keys) as modeling metadata documentation
    - Cosmos DB: improved reverse-engineering to ensure correct conversion of unsupported types within union definitions
    - CosmosDB with SQL API: removed extraneous Binary data type to ensure compliance with native JSON data types
    - CosmosDB with Gremlin API, JanusGraph, Neo4j, Neptune, Tinkerpop: updated for compatibility with new Polyglot references when derive from and convert to Polyglot
    - Snowflake: updated SDK and lodash libraries, plus replaced Axios with proxy fetch library, plus reordered log file
    - Synapse: added resolution of model definition references in DDL forward-engineering through hydration of objects
