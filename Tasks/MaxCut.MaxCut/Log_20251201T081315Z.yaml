      Right-clicking a panel hyperlink now highlights the corresponding panel in the Optimization Layout for quicker navigation and clarity.
    - Sheet dimensions on printed Job Layouts for rotated diagrams
      Printed Job Layouts maintain clear spacing and accurate placement of sheet measurements, even when the on-screen diagram is rotated or flipped.
    - Re-Optimize prompt when including previously excluded items
      Re-including input items, or making changes to pricing or other optimization-related settings, now prompts for re-optimization. The Re-optimize button appears when you open the Optimized Sheets tab, keeping results up to date.
