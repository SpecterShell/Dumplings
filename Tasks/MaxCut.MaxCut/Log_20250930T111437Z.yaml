    Updates
    - Improved Grooving Input Dialog
      - Adding and managing grooves is now a smoother experience with a new dialog that allows you to better visualize your grooving.
      - Add or duplicate grooves with a single click, or edit them by selecting them directly from the diagram.
      - The selected groove is highlighted for easy identification, while familiar fields (Offset, Width, Depth, Length) remain unchanged.

    - Improved Holes Input Dialog
      - The holes dialog now matches the upgraded grooving experience, offering a visual preview and easier tools to add, duplicate, and manage holes confidently.

    - Grain Match – Smarter and More Flexible
      - Rotation Locked for Accuracy: Rotation is now disabled for panels in a grain match group, ensuring perfect alignment without accidental changes.
      - Quick Panel Removal: A new “Remove Panel” button in the simple dialog lets you remove panels from groups instantly.
      - Clearer Panel Identification: Edging indicators highlight subtle differences, helping you distinguish panels that share the same name and size but aren’t identical.
      - Helpful New Prompts: When matching panels already in a group, you’ll now see options to edit the existing group or move panels into a new one, with behavior tailored to your selection.
