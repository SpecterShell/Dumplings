    Updates
    - Grain Match: Rotation Behaviour
      - Rotation is now disabled on grain-matched panels to preserve the group’s defined grain alignment.
      - When attempting to rotate a grain-matched panel (either in the panel editor or during optimization), users will now see a clear warning that rotation settings will not affect panels in a Grain Match Group.
    - Quantity Changes on Grain Matched Panels
      - Panel positions now automatically update when a panel’s Qty is reduced, removing any positions beyond the updated quantity.
      - Increasing a panel’s quantity (e.g., from 1 to 3) prompts the user to include those panels in the grain match group.
      - When editing or creating a grain-matched panel while only some of its quantities are included in the group, users are now prompted to add the missing quantities.
    - Grain Match Validation: Group Does Not Fit on Sheet
      - The Grain Match Group dialog now performs early validation to detect when the group layout cannot fit on the selected sheet.
      - Panels that cannot be placed are visually marked as invalid.
      - On save, users receive a clear warning with the option to proceed or cancel.
      - The grain match group is not placed on the optimization.
    - DXF Export: More Descriptive File Names
      - DXF exports now use more meaningful file names by default.
      - Implemented the format: Material – Layout x of y (x occurrences), helping users easily identify files by material and layout sequence.
