    New Features
    - Keyboard Shortcut Discovery
      - Added an overlay that reveals available keyboard shortcuts directly next to UI elements.
      - Users can see the overlaid keyboard shortcuts by holding the '?' (question mark) key.
      - Makes shortcuts easier to discover and helps power users work faster without having to memorize key combinations.

    Updates
    - Expanded Support Bundle Logging
      - The support bundle now includes additional logs to provide clearer insight into errors and issues users may encounter.
      - This reduces back-and-forth requests for information and speeds up issue diagnosis.

    Fixes
    - CSV Import Defaults When Columns Are Skipped
      - When CSV columns are blank or ignored, MaxCut now correctly applies the user-defined Input Item Default Settings.
      - This results in consistent, predictable imports that match the defaults configured by the user.
    - Exact-Fit Panel Optimization (Beta Engine)
      - The beta optimization engine now successfully completes optimization when panels fit a sheet perfectly.
      - Valid, exact-fit layouts are now handled correctly without requiring size adjustments.
