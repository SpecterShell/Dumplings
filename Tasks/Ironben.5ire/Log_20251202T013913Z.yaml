    What's New
    Data layer fully rebuilt.
    We’ve migrated the storage engine from SQLite + LanceDB to pglite.
    This refactor doesn’t introduce new features yet, but it lays a solid foundation for upcoming improvements and enhanced capabilities. Updating is recommended to stay compatible with future releases.
    Update Strategy Change
    Auto-update disabled.
    Future versions will no longer install automatically.
    Instead, you’ll receive a notification when a new version is available and can update manually at your convenience.
    📌 Notes
    Existing data will be migrated automatically during the upgrade.
