    Behind the scenes
    Most of the recent work happened under the hood, it mainly focuses on stability and long-term reliability.
    We rewrote the data layer, consolidating SQLite and LanceDB into PGlite, and reworked the MCP protocol layer to improve tool execution and enable resource- and prompt-level support.
    We have ambitious plans for 5ire in 2026 — and recent work is about laying a solid foundation to make that possible.
