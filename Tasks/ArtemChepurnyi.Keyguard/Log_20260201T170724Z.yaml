    This update introduces several platform-specific enhancements and general fixes. For Android users, the "Allow screenshot" option can now display an optional visual cue, and the app will react to system light/dark mode changes without recreating the screen. Support has also been added for marking copied values as sensitive on pre-Tiramisu devices. On desktop platforms, the application has been migrated to a native Compose tray. Finally, this release resolves an issue causing "en-US" to appear twice in the language selector and adds support for re-prompting on Custom field actions.
