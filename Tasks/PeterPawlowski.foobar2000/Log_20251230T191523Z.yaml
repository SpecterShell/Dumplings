  Value: |-
    - Refined workaround for foo_tags (M-Tags) component bugs. No longer hammers all subsongs when starting playback.
    - Default User Interface: made cycling tabs by keyboard shortcuts cancel tab rename in progress.
    - Converter: Made "no DSP reset" explicitly shown in overview, as it's dangerous if enabled unintentionally.
    - Fixed various regressions with network shares in Media Library preferences page.
    - File Operations: Fixed error with renaming files on redirected portable music folders.
    - Fixed tag writing issues on fragmented/streaming M4A/MP4 files.
