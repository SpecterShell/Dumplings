    Added
    - Install RPM assets (#335)
    - Download selection mode now supports wildcard pattern, using *
      and ? special characters, to select the first asset matching the given
      pattern (#271).
      This new feature is useful when release assets contain sections that change for each release (e.g. a build number or
      timestamp).
      For example, dra download -s 'helloworld*_amd64.deb' devmatteini/dra-tests.
      Selection mode is backward compatible with previous versions. You can still pass literal or untagged patterns.
    Changed
    - Rewrite download automatic mode, without any breaking change, to be more customizable, reliable and easier to
      maintain.
    Fixed
    - Handle more Windows OS formats in install script (#336)
