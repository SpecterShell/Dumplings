    What's Changed
    Minor update which has some code and documentation changes as well as one bugfix:
    - check_process should show memory values in human readable form i.e. 1234567 (bytes) should be converted to 1.236MB. This is similar to how other size related check work.
      An example of how it now looks:
    check_process "warn=working_set > 3G" "crit=working_set > 5G" "detail-syntax=%(exe) working-set: %(working_set)"
    L        cli WARNING: WARNING: clion64.exe working-set: 3.945GB
