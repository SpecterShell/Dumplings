    🎉 ProseFlow v0.2.0 – Release Notes
    We’re thrilled to announce ProseFlow v0.2.0, a major milestone that significantly expands the application’s capabilities with powerful new features, refined user experience, and robust infrastructure improvements. This release introduces shared workspace support, a floating action orb, diff view for safe editing, background task tracking, and much more.

    🌟 Highlights
    1. Shared Workspace & Team Sync
    Collaborate seamlessly with your team! ProseFlow now supports shared workspaces—a folder (local or cloud-synced) that stores your Actions and Provider configurations.
    - Connect to a shared workspace during onboarding or via Settings.
    - Encrypt sensitive data (like API keys) using a workspace password.
    - Choose between Manual or Automatic sync modes.
    - Resolve conflicts with configurable strategies: Overwrite, Skip, or Prompt.
    💡 Ideal for teams wanting consistent AI workflows across machines.

    2. Floating Action Orb
    A persistent, draggable orb floats on your screen—offering instant access to ProseFlow without memorizing hotkeys.
    - Click to open the Floating Action Menu.
    - Right-click for a quick context menu (Open App, Quit, Close Orb).
    - Drag & drop text onto the orb to trigger the new Arc Menu—a radial menu of your favorite or context-relevant actions.
    - Shows a live badge indicating active background tasks.
    - Fully customizable: hide it in Settings if preferred.

    3. Diff View for Safe Editing
    When using actions with Diff output mode, you’ll now see a side-by-side comparison of your original and AI-generated text.
    - Accept, Refine, Regenerate, or Cancel with confidence.
    - Powered by DiffPlex with word-level highlighting for precise changes.
    - Supports inline refinement instructions for iterative improvements.
    ✅ Perfect for critical edits where you need full control over AI output.

    4. Background Task Tracker
    All AI actions are now tracked in real time on the Overview Dashboard.
    - See active processes, their status (Queued/Processing), and elapsed time.
    - Cancel long-running tasks directly from the UI.
    - Visual feedback on the Floating Orb and in notifications.

    🛠️ Core & Infrastructure Improvements
    🔐 Enhanced Clipboard Service
    A new multi-layered fallback system ensures reliable text selection and pasting across all platforms:
    1. Avalonia API (primary)
    2. Native shell commands (xclip, pbcopy, clip.exe)
    3. TextCopy library (fallback)
    Greatly improves compatibility with WSL, remote desktops, and sandboxed environments.
    ⌨️ Advanced Hotkey System
    - Hotkey recording UI in Settings with live feedback.
    - Conflict detection to prevent duplicate shortcuts.
    - Unified APIs for key registration and monitoring and enhance support for non-U.S. keyboards.
    🧠 Local Model Enhancements
    - GPU selection: Choose a specific GPU or let the system auto-select.
    - Flash Attention support for faster inference (enabled by default).
    - Thread control: Adjust CPU thread count for optimal performance.
    - Context and token limits increased to 65,536.
    📊 Hardware Monitoring
    - GPU detection and VRAM reporting (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel).
    - Polling pauses when the main window is hidden to conserve resources.
    - Hardware metrics now feed into the Local Dashboard sidebar.

    🎨 UI & UX Refinements
    📁 History View Overhaul
    - Searchable and filterable history (by Action Name, Input, or Output).
    - Delete individual entries or clear all.
    - Improved layout with virtualization for performance.
    ⚙️ Settings Revamp
    - Workspace Sync section with full connection management.
    - Behavior toggles: Start minimized, hide Floating Orb.

    - Overview Dashboard now includes:
      - Total tokens (cloud + local combined)
      - Application log console (real-time)
      - Active background processes widget
    - Local Dashboard gains inference speed metrics and hardware sidebar.
    - Animated KPIs using the new AnimatingTextBlockBehavior.
    🪟 Window Management
    - Main window now saves/restores visibility state.
    - Splash screen provides visual feedback during startup.
    - Smoother page transitions in the main window.

    🧪 Developer & Quality Improvements
    - Structured logging with class names and real-time UI display.
    - Enum-based output modes (InPlace, Windowed, Diff, Default) replace boolean flags.
    - Action favorites system for prioritizing frequently used commands.
    - Onboarding flow is now non-modal and runs atop a fully initialized app.
    - Database schema updated to support new features (migrations included).
    - Dependency updates: Avalonia 11.3.7, LlmTornado 3.7.45, SharpHook 7.0.3.

    🐞 Bug Fixes
    - Fixed issues with hardware monitoring on macOS ARM64.
    - Resolved clipboard restoration edge cases.
    - Corrected token usage reporting for cloud providers.
