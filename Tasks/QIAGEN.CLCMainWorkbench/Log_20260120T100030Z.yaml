    QIAGEN CLC Main Workbench
    Improvements
    - Exporting PDFs of reports that contain plots with many points is faster than previously.
    - Various minor improvements
    Bug fixes
    - Fixed an issue in Create Sequence Constructs where, when a saved Sequence List was used as input and at least three sequences in that list were deselected, roughly half of the deselected sequences would be included in the construct set generated.
    - Fixed an issue causing the "Pairwise % identity" value in the Positional stats palette in the Side Panel of alignments to be incorrectly calculated.
    - Fixes relating to history information in results of workflow analyses:
      - Fixed an issue affecting the history information in outputs generated using installed workflows that contained at least one Fork element with all its output channels connected to downstream steps, where the workflow version was reported as 0.0 and no build-id was included.
      - Fixed an issue affecting the history of workflow log elements generated by running a workflow on a CLC Workbench, where the details of the workflow run (name, version, and where relevant, build id) were not present. This problem did not affect log elements generated by analyses run on a CLC Server or on the cloud.
      - The following fixes affecting history information in outputs generated by workflows run on the cloud:
        - Details of the workflow run (name, version, and where relevant, build id) were not present in the history of Workflow Result Metadata elements.
        - History information in outputs generated using installed workflows did not contain the correct workflow build-id.
        - History information in outputs from workflows launched from the workflow editor contained a workflow build-id when there should not have been one.
    - Various minor bug fixes
    - CVEs fixed in this release include:
      - CVE-2025-67735
      - CVE-2025-12183
