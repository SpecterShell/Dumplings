    Azure and Google Cloud support
    We have added Azure and Google Cloud support to our cloud connection functionality. Now you can connect to your cloud account from DataGrip, discover the databases stored in it, and create data sources for any of them within the same Data Sources and Drivers dialog.
    To connect to your account, navigate to New | Data Source from Cloud Provider and select the cloud you want to connect to.
    For now, you need to have the Azure Cloud Explorer plugin installed to use the Azure support.

    [Amazon Redshift] Introspection levels
    This release adds the introspection levels feature to DataGrip’s Amazon Redshift functionality. With this feature, DataGrip automatically adjusts the amount of metadata loaded for a database based on its size, which can save you a significant amount of time because you don’t have to worry about large databases slowing things down. You can also select a different introspection level for each schema based on your task requirements.

    Bug fixes and improvements
    - DBE-23109: The Data Sources and Drivers dialog shortcut Cmd+; / Ctrl+; in query files now works as expected.
