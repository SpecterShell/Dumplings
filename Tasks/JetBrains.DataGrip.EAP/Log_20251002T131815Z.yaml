    AWS cloud support
    DataGrip now works with cloud database providers! From now on, you can connect your AWS account to the IDE, browse the list of databases you have in it, and choose the ones you’d like to connect to. DataGrip will create a new data source, filling in all connection details. Support for Azure and Google Cloud is to follow.
    To connect to your AWS account, click New | Data Source from Cloud Provider | AWS.

    All the cloud databases connected to your IDE are displayed in the Cloud tab of the Data Sources and Drivers dialog.

    Explain Plan button on the query file toolbar
    We have made the Explain Plan actions more accessible. Now you can click the Explain Plan button right on the query file toolbar to access them.

    Action for the Migration to Query Files dialog
    We recently bid farewell to query consoles, migrating them to query files. Originally, the migration dialog appeared in projects whose consoles had not yet been migrated. We’ve now added a Migrate Query Consoles to Query Files context menu action so you can access the dialog even if query files already exist in your project. The action is available in any query console left in a project. You can use it, for instance, if you chose not to migrate your consoles at first, or if you had only converted some of them back then and now need to migrate others.

    [Microsoft SQL Server] Clustered and nonclustered columnstore indexes support
    DataGrip now supports creating and modifying clustered and nonclustered columnstore indexes for Microsoft SQL Server. You can work with them in code generation and also use the indexes in the Create and Modify dialogs.

    Bug fixes and improvements
    - DBE-24279: Custom database drivers now work as expected.
    - DBE-14950: [Oracle] Code highlighting now works for the following functions: ANY_VALUE, RAW_TO_UUID, SKEWNESS_POP, SKEWNESS_SAMP, STANDARD_HASH, UUID, UUID_TO_RAW, and VALIDATE_CONVERSION.
