    In addition to a number of bug fixes, this update has two
    new/improved tools under the Tools menu.

    The Fringe Calculator has significant updates.  It now works for
    calculating either object declination or fringe period. Two new
    plots are available.  Plot Fringe vs Declination gives you a
    look at how these parameters relate. Plot Fringe Pattern
    produces a graph of how the relative intensity of a signal
    changes during meridian transit. Plots are available for
    Phase Switched or Adding type instruments.

    A Dispersion Measure (DM) calculator has been added.  Given
    upper and lower frequencies and the time delay of signal
    appearance between them, DM is calculated. Also the
    expected delay for a given DM may be computed.

    A catalog of FRBs (fast radio bursta) from the CHIME group
    is now included.

    I am aware that some of the included Active Label files
    (.rls), no longer function due to website changes on
    their target URLs.  I am working on this.

    On Line Help has a new look.  Clear your old pages when
    using it.
