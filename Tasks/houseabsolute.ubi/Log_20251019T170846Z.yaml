    - Fixed a bug introduced in 0.8.0, which caused ubi to prefer the browser_download_url over the url for a GitHub asset. When both are present, it will now use the url field. This is important because when downloading assets from a private repo, the url will work with the authentication headers that ubi sets. Fixed by @rnaveiras (Ra√∫l Naveiras). GH #139.
    - Added more context to errors and made ubi display the full error context when it fails. This should help with debugging issues like #136.
