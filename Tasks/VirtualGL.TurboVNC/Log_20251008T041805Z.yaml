    Significant changes relative to 3.2:
    1. Fixed an issue in the TurboVNC Viewer whereby the "Default Window Size/Position" feature did not work properly in full-screen mode if TVNC_SINGLESCREEN/turbovnc.singlescreen was enabled.
    2. When using server-side key mapping, the Windows TurboVNC Viewer now works around an issue whereby the operating system does not send a key release event to applications if one of the Shift keys is released while the other Shift key remains pressed. 2.2.4[1] worked around this issue when using client-side key mapping, but due to an oversight, the server-side key mapping feature introduced in 3.1 beta1[4] did not include the same workaround.
    3. The default X startup script (xstartup.turbovnc) now assigns the same priority to session desktop files located in /usr/share/wayland-sessions and /usr/share/xsessions. This prevents an issue on Fedora 40 and later whereby, if GNOME and Xfce or MATE were installed but the (now optional) gnome-session-xsession package was not installed, TurboVNC used Xfce or MATE as the default window manager rather than GNOME.
