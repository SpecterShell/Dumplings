  Value: |-
    - Added source path metadata to images dragged onto the terminal, helping Claude understand where images originated
    - Added clickable hyperlinks for file paths in tool output in terminals that support OSC 8 (like iTerm)
    - Added support for Windows Package Manager (winget) installations with automatic detection and update instructions
    - Added Shift+Tab keyboard shortcut in plan mode to quickly select "auto-accept edits" option
    - Added FORCE_AUTOUPDATE_PLUGINS environment variable to allow plugin autoupdate even when the main auto-updater is disabled
    - Added agent_type to SessionStart hook input, populated if --agent is specified
    - Fixed a command injection vulnerability in bash command processing where malformed input could execute arbitrary commands
    - Fixed a memory leak where tree-sitter parse trees were not being freed, causing WASM memory to grow unbounded over long sessions
    - Fixed binary files (images, PDFs, etc.) being accidentally included in memory when using @include directives in CLAUDE.md files
    - Fixed updates incorrectly claiming another installation is in progress
    - Fixed crash when socket files exist in watched directories (defense-in-depth for EOPNOTSUPP errors)
    - Fixed remote session URL and teleport being broken when using /tasks command
    - Fixed MCP tool names being exposed in analytics events by sanitizing user-specific server configurations
    - Improved Option-as-Meta hint on macOS to show terminal-specific instructions for native CSIu terminals like iTerm2, Kitty, and WezTerm
    - Improved error message when pasting images over SSH to suggest using scp instead of the unhelpful clipboard shortcut hint
    - Improved permission explainer to not flag routine dev workflows (git fetch/rebase, npm install, tests, PRs) as medium risk
    - Changed large bash command outputs to be saved to disk instead of truncated, allowing Claude to read the full content
    - Changed large tool outputs to be persisted to disk instead of truncated, providing full output access via file references
    - Changed /plugins installed tab to unify plugins and MCPs with scope-based grouping
    - Deprecated Windows managed settings path C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json - administrators should migrate to C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json
    - [SDK] Changed minimum zod peer dependency to ^4.0.0
    - [VSCode] Fixed usage display not updating after manual compact
