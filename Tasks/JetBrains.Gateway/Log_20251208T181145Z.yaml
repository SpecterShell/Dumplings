    The Gateway 2025.3 is out with the following updates:
    - Various typing latency issues have been addressed for injected languages, Dockerfiles, shell scripts, and XML and JS/TS files.
    - Several interaction experience improvements have been made, for example:
      - The build nodes tree UI has been moved from the backend to the frontend to reduce latency.
      - The Services view architecture has been re-implemented to improve interaction latency during remote development (including for Docker, databases, the Run tool window, and Kubernetes integrated services).
    - Paid plugins can now be installed and enabled on the frontend.
    - Remote and local plugin configurables now appear on a single page. Additionally, a detection mechanism is used during plugin installation to determine where the plugin should be installed.
    - The MCP server dialog for remote development IDE instances now works as intended.
    - Other improvements include enhanced support for passing images through LUX, additional fixes related to custom window layout settings in remote development IDE instances, and minor bug fixes.
