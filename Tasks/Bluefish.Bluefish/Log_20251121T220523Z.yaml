  Value: A regression was found in the Bluefish 2.2.18 release. This is fixed in the Bluefish 2.2.19 release. The only other change is that the the dynamic menu shortcut changing feature that was re-introduced in 2.2.18 for the main menu is now also working for the snippets menu.
ReleaseTime: 2025-11-21
