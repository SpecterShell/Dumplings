  Key: ReleaseNotes
  Value: Bluefish 2.4.0 has some new features and many small improvements. It is no longer a 2.2 release because backwards compatibility with the 2.0 series of Bluefish has been removed. If you upgrade from 2.0 straight to 2.4 your config files and project files are no longer 100% correctly loaded. Starting from 2.4 Bluefish will place config files no longer in ~/.bluefish. On Linux it will be ~/.config and ~/.local/ , on Windows LocalAppData and RoamingAppData, and ~/Library/Application support on OSX. The biggest new feature, still experimental, is that you can edit two document side-by-side. A second new feature is that you can change opening and ending tags in XML or HTML simultaneously if you hit [ctrl][t]. Anothe new feature is that you can more easily save the current contents to a template. For new users, and also active in new projects, is a UI selection dialog, where you can choose between a UI optimised for web development, programming or just have everything enabled or disabled. This will help new Bluefish users to customize Bluefish in an easier way. There are a few fixes as well. Selecting lines by dragging in the margin works more reliable. Paste special works more reliable. Line comments in Python are better detected, which is visible in the syntax highlighting, but also improved the toggle comment function. The Windows build has better error messages when starting external commands fails.
ReleaseTime: 2026-02-01
