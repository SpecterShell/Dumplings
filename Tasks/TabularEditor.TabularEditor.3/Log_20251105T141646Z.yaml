    Improvements in 3.24.1
    - Added Semantic Analyzer support for new data type keywords LOGICAL, INT64, DECIMAL, and TEXT (which are all aliases of existing keywords) that can be used as arguments of functions such as CONVERT and DATATABLE.
    - Added Semantic Analyzer support for new functions, ISINTEGER, ISCURRENCY, and visual calculation function LOOKUPWITHTOTALS.
    - Added "Manage DAX Packages..." menu option when right-clicking on the Model or Functions node in the TOM Explorer.
    Bugfixes in 3.24.1
    - Fixed a bug that caused an unhandled exception when launching Tabular Editor 3 on a monitor with a low pixel resolution
    - Fixed a bug that prevented opening a model from a PBIP folder structure, when using the File > Open > Model from File... menu option, see #1507.
    - Fixed DPI scaling issues related to the DAX Package Manager view.
    - Fixed Semantic Analyzer bug where visual calculation functions FIRST and LAST were not recognized.
    - Fixed Semantic Analyzer bug that would show a false warning when calling an UDF as the first argument of CALCULATE, see #1509.
    - DAX Package Manager no longer shows a warning because of differences in line endings in the DAX expression (PBI Desktop may change \n to \r\n when saving a model).
    - Fix ordering of UDFs among namespaces in the TOM Explorer
