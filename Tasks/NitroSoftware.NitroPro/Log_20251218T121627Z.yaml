    Fixed Issues & Improvements
    Improved PDF/A Compliance & Expanded Archival Format Support
    - Nitro PDF Pro 14.42 delivers a major upgrade to its PDF/A engine. The core conformance library has been updated to ensure more reliable, standards-aligned PDF/A output after conversion, and Nitro now supports the full family of PDF/A-3 variants:
      - PDF/A-3a
      - PDF/A-3b
      - PDF/A-3u
    - The expanded PDF/A-3 support significantly increases Nitro's compatibility with modern archival, accessibility, and document-exchange standards and empowers users to create archival-grade PDFs with embedded data, accessibility, and enhanced search-ability.
    Stability & Reliability
    - Crash prevention improvements:
      - Added robust memory checks to prevent rare crashes when rendering large or complex images.
      - Fixed a crash that occurred when editing documents with corrupt page trees — the app now handles such files gracefully without crashing.
    - Improved error handling:
      - Fixed scenarios where documents could become locked and undeletable after failed PDF/A conversions.
      - Resolved two issues that previously prevented successful FDF data imports for documents with template pages or nested form fields.
    - Display & character handling:
      - Fixed corruption issues when editing documents containing Macron characters (used in Māori and similar languages).
      - Annotations with Chinese or other non-Latin text now display and can be edited correctly in Adobe Acrobat.
    Compatibility & Feature Enhancements
    - Annotation standardization:
      - Corrected a minor spec typo in text annotation intent (FreeTextTypeWriter), improving compatibility with third-party viewers like MuPDF. Backward compatibility with older annotations is maintained.
    - Signature handling:
      - Improved consistency by displaying signer names only from the certificate, ensuring accuracy even when annotations contain inconsistent data.
    - Redaction enhancements:
      - Refined overlay text behavior:
        - Fixed font sizing logic for "Auto" mode to ensure text fully fits within the redaction area.
        - Disabled "Repeat text" when auto-sizing is enabled.
    Security & Compliance
    - Updated core components: Upgraded the FreeType library to v2.14.1, addressing known vulnerabilities.
    - Enhanced registry protection: Closed a potential loophole where URLs could be injected via registry keys.
    - Safer timestamp handling: Fixed parsing issues for timestamps from Entrust timestamp servers, ensuring signature verification consistency.
    Cloud & Integration Improvements
    - iManage integration:
      - Added options to follow redirections in all iManage calls.
      - Introduced new feature flag imanage.redirect_to_default_if_wrong_server for flexible connection handling.
      - Fixed an issue that caused auto-tagging to fail when opening documents from iManage remote storage.
    - SharePoint integration:
      - Streamlined auto-tagging workflow to reduce redundant confirmation prompts during document opening.
    UX & Productivity Enhancements
    - Batch processing: The "Ask before overwriting an existing file" option is now enabled by default, helping users avoid accidental data loss.
    - UI consistency:
      - Disabled drag-and-drop reordering in the signature tree to prevent confusion.
      - Exposed the former skip_image_merge registry option in the Printer Preferences UI, improving accessibility for power users.
    Internal & Engineering Improvements
    - Fixed internal build job failures and removed redundant dependencies to simplify maintenance.
    - Added new automated test coverage to strengthen regression protection for future updates.
