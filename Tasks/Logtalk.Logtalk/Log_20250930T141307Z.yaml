    - ADDED: Object and category references/2 property for querying entity references in calls to the execution-context built-in methods and in directives for multifile predicates/non-terminals not covered by other properties.

    Documentation

    - UPDATED: The tutor tool to explain the new linter warning for entity parameters not in parameter variable syntax.
    - FIXED: The debugger tool to not change from debugging with breakpoints to tracing for the next top-level query if the trace/0 predicate was not used.
    - FIXED: The debugger tool to allow creating a triggered breakpoint that depends on a clause breakpoint for a parametric entity.

    - FIXED: VSCode support failure to find a predicate declaration from a clause for a multifile predicate or from a multifile/1 predicate directive.
    - FIXED: VSCode support find_references/4 predicate bug where some references would be missed in the case of parametric entities.
