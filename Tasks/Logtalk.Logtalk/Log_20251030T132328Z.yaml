    - IMPROVED: The diagrams tool generated diagram node links by encompassing just the relevant text.
    - IMPROVED: The lgtunit tool lint checking of test assertions.
    - UPDATED: The tutor tool to explain the new lgtunit tool linter warnings.
    - UPDATED: The lgtunit tool to allow using failed_test_reason//1 as a public non-terminal to better support IDEs such as VSCode.
    - UPDATED: The code_metrics, help, lgtdoc, and tutor tools for the new mode_non_terminal/2 directive.
    - UPDATED: The dead_code_scanner tool for additional tests using use_module/2 directives.
    - UPDATED: The diagrams tool to also load the Mermaid experimental support.
