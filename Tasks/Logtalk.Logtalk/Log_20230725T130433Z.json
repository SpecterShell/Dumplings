      "Value": "Logtalk compiler and runtime\n- ADDED: New logtalk_load_context/2 predicate entity_relation key to access the entity (being compiled) relations from its opening directive. After a suggestion and prototype code from Yurii Rashkovskii.\n- FIXED: Harmless singleton variable warnings in the logtalk built-in object when using some embedding scripts.\nProlog adapter and integration files\n- UPDATED: GNU Prolog adapter file for the format/2-3 predicate changes in version 1.6.0.\n- UPDATED: The LVM adapter file to require version 6.3.0 or later.\n- FIXED: Workaround a LVM embedding application issue with loading of plug-in shared libraries.\nLibrary\n- ADDED: LVM support to the library parallel_logtalk_processes_setup.pl file.\nTools\n- ADDED: Support to the logtalk_doclet.* scripts for using a GNU Prolog executable that includes Logtalk for better performance. With the help of Daniel Diaz.\n- IMPROVED: The lgtunit tool now prints all test execution times with nine decimal digits to simplify comparing test runs. Thanks to Daniel Diaz for the suggestion.\n- IMPROVED: The packs tool installed/0-1 and outdated/0-1 predicates to list packs in alphabetical order.\n- IMPROVED: The packs tool update/0 predicate to inform when a pack is orphaned.\n- IMPROVED: The packs tool update/1-3 predicates to print an error message when a pack is orphaned.\n- IMPROVED: When using the packs tool to install a pack using git archive, delete any empty archive file created when the remote connection fails.\n- IMPROVED: When using the packs tool to install a pack using curl, fail on HTTP server errors instead of creating an archive file with the HTTP error.\n- IMPROVED: The packs tool now reports the pack or registry download full command in case of failure instead of the URL or the asset path.\n- FIXED: Bug in the packs tool where installing a pack when its archive was previously downloaded using git archive would result in a mangled directory structure.\n- FIXED: Bug in the packs tool where installing a pack would fail when updating installed dependencies was required.\nExamples\n- IMPROVED: Simplify the Java example scripts that set the required CLASSPATH environment variable.\n- UPDATED: Notes of the tabling object on current limitations.\n- UPDATED: The errors example to illustrate errors occurring in the first source file line (mainly to test IDEs and text editors support).\nTests\n- ADDED: Tests for the call_nth/2 predicate found on increasing number of Prolog systems.\n- ADDED: Additional tests for Prolog standard syntax for terms adapted from WG17 work.\n- ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard asserta/1, assertz/1, bagof/3, copy_term/2, msort/2, setof/3, sort/2, and term_variables/2 predicates adapted from WG17 work.\n- ADDED: Additional tests for the Prolog standard write_term/2 predicate.\n- FIXED: Enable running the evaluable_property/2 predicate tests when using SWI-Prolog as the backend.\nInstallers and installation scripts\n- CHANGED: The SWI-Prolog based Docker image to use swipl:stable instead of swipl:latest.\n- CHANGED: All embedding scripts to patch the backend adapter files to change the settings_file flag value from allow to deny when also embedding a setting file. This prevents the generated files to to try to load (another) setting file when loaded.\n- ADDED: LVM embedding scripts support for copying all plug-in foreign library files used by an application and generate an auxiliary loader.pl file.\n- ADDED: SWI-Prolog embedding scripts support for specifying the foreign object action when building standalone saved states. Contributed by Yurii Rashkovskii.\n- UPDATED: All embedding scripts to use expand_library_alias_paths(loader) instead of the deprecated loader file."
