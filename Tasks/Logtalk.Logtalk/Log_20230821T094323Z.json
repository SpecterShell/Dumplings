      "Value": "Logtalk compiler and runtime\n- FIXED: Compilation of read_term/2-3 and write_term/2-3 goals would fail to take into account local operator definitions when the portability flag was set to silent (its default value).\nProlog adapter and integration files\n- UPDATED: The LVM adapter file list of proprietary predicate properties for version 6.4.0.\n- FIXED: Workaround a LVM embedding application issue with plug-ins where the registry name differs from the shared library basename.\nDocumentation\n- IMPROVED: Documentation of the op/3 directive.\n- IMPROVED: Documentation of the asserta/1 and assertz/1 built-in methods.\n- IMPROVED: Documentation of the diagrams tool path_url_prefixes/3 and omit_path_prefixes/1 options.\n- IMPROVED: Documentation of the lgtunit tool on writing and running tests.\nLibrary\n- ADDED: Experimental os::full_device_path/1 library predicate. Currently limited to Linux and BSD systems.\n- ADDED: Experimental os::read_only_device_path/1 library predicate. Currently limited to macOS systems.\n- ADDED: Predicate approximately_equal/2 to the number library object.\n- IMPROVED: The number object documentation of the approximately_equal/3 and essentially_equal/3 predicates.\nTools\n- CHANGED: The lgtunit tool to handle a non-deterministic success test result as any other test failure (thus suppressing non_deterministic_success/6 print messages).\n- ADDED: Predicate approximately_equal/2 to the lgtunit tool.\n- ADDED: The lgtunit tool now supports a flaky/0 test option as the preferred solution for declaring flaky tests.\n- IMPROVED: The lgtunit tool documentation of the approximately_equal/3 and essentially_equal/3 predicates.\n- IMPROVED: The diagrams tool DOT language support no longer sets the graph pack attribute to true to avoid frequent Graphviz dot command crashes when converting graphs to SVG format.\n- IMPROVED: The lgtdoc tool support for documenting libraries where source files are organized in multiple sub-directories.\n- IMPROVED: The tutor tool explanations for some message sending warnings.\n- FIXED: The lgtunit tool xUnit reports escaping of XML special characters.\n- FIXED: Bug in the packs tool warning message when installing a pack requires updating the backend Prolog system. Thanks to Jacob Friedman for the bug report.\nExamples\n- IMPROVED: The metapredicates example.\n- UPDATED: The document_converter example to allow converting large files and to turn off OCR for faster testing. Also added samples in formats other than PDF. Tested with Apache Tika 2.8.0.\nTests\n- ADDED: Additional tests for the Logtalk op/3 directive for checking the semantics of the read_term/2-3, read/1-2, write_term/2-3, writeq/1-2, and write/1-2 predicates in the presence of local operator definitions.\nInstallers and installation scripts\n- UPDATED: The LVM embedding scripts to support encryption of the generated Prolog files. Requires LVM 6.4.0 or later version.\nIDEs, text editors, and syntax highlighters support\n- UPDATED: Link to the new home for the VSCode Logtalk plug-in."
