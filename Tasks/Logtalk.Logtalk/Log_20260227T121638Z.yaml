    Logtalk compiler and runtime
    - CHANGED: The create_object/4 and create_category/4 built-in predicates no longer silently accept (and generalize) a compound entity identifier with parameters that are not variables. Attempts to create a parametric entity with a non-variable parameter now throw a type error, consistent with the compiler behavior for source files defined parametric entities.
    - FIXED: Compiler bug where a file initialization/1 directive calling the create_object/4 built-in predicate with valid object relation arguments would result in a compiler error. Thanks to Paul Brown for the bug report.
    - FIXED: Compiler bug where compiling an include/1 directive where the included file contains uses/2 or use_module/2 directives that define operators would result in syntax errors.
    - FIXED: Runtime error in the predicate_property/2 built-in method when the predicate argument is defined via a uses/2 or use_module/2 directive where the object or module argument is a parameter variable only bound at runtime.
    Prolog adapter and integration files
    - UPDATED: The gplgt.sh script to export the LINEDIT environment variable (set to gui=no) to allow running it on Windows using a Bash shell.
    - FIXED: The SICStus Prolog adapter file to import the forall/2 predicate from the aggregate library instead of defining it locally, thus avoiding a predicate redefinition warning when this library is imported.
    - FIXED: The logtalk_setup_env.sh integration helper script to write error messages to stderr instead of stdout.
