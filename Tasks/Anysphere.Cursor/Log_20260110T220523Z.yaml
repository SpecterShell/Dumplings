    For this holiday release, we've focused entirely on fixing bugs and improving stability.
    This includes the core agent, layout controls, viewing code diffs, and more. We will be slowly rolling these updates out over the week, ensuring there are no regressions during your holiday coding.

    Layout customization
    It's now easier to customize your default layout across workspaces.
    We've included four default layouts: agent, editor, zen, and browser. You can use Command (⌘) + Option (⌥) + Tab (⇥) to switch between layouts, or easily jump between different workspaces. Additionally, you can move backwards in this list by including Shift (⇧), similar to macOS.
