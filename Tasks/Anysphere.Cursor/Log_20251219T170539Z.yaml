    #Debug Mode
    Debug Mode helps you reproduce and fix the most tricky bugs.
    Cursor instruments your app with runtime logs to find the root cause. It works across stacks, languages, and models.
    Read more in our announcement.

    #Browser layout and style editor
    Design and code simultaneously with a brand new browser sidebar and component tree.
    Move elements, update colors, test layouts, and experiment with CSS in real time, then instantly apply changes to your codebase using agent. You can also click on multiple elements and describe changes in text to kick off an agent to make visual changes.
    Read more in our announcement.

    #Plan Mode improvements
    Plan Mode now supports inline Mermaid diagrams, allowing the agent to automatically generate and stream visuals into your plans. You also have more control over how you build them, with the option to send selected to-dos to new agents.

    #Multi-agent judging
    When running multiple agents in parallel, Cursor will now automatically evaluate all runs and give a recommendation for the best solution.
    The selected agent will have a comment explaining why it was picked. Judging of the best solution only happens after all parallel agents have finished.

    #Pinned chats
    In the agent sidebar, pin chats at the top for future reference.
