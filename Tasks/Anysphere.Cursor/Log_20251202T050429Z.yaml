    Improved Plan Mode
    When creating plans, Cursor responds with clarifying questions to improve the plan quality. Cursor now shows an interactive UI to easily answer questions.
    You can also ⌘+F to search inside generated plans.

    AI Code Reviews
    You can now find and fix bugs directly in Cursor with AI code reviews. It will look at your changes and find issues which you can see in the sidepanel.
    This is in addition to Bugbot, which runs on your source control provider like GitHub (including Enterprise Server), GitLab, and more.

    Instant Grep (Beta)
    All grep commands run by the agent are now instant.
    Instant grep is supported by all models in Cursor. It is also used when manually searching the codebase from the sidebar, including regexes and matching on word boundaries.
    This improvement is slowly rolling out to 2.1 users over the next week.
