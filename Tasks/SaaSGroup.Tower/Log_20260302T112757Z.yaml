    Improved
    Commit Composing: Auto-complete commands are now case-sensitive. Working Tree: Improved refresh behavior so large diffs stay expanded while staging chunks or individual lines. Submodules: Improved handling for repositories that do not report a HEAD branch. Worktrees: Improved repository path handling when opening worktrees.
    Fixed
    Crash: Fixed a crash during Stage All operations in large repositories. Crash: Fixed a crash during startup fetch operations. Crash: Fixed a crash when refreshing Bitbucket Server pull requests. Crash: Fixed a crash when checking out remote branches via sidebar double-click. UI: Fixed vertically misaligned labels in segmented buttons. Sidebar: Fixed keyboard navigation after indirect selection changes (for example via Quick Actions), so arrow-key navigation now continues from the currently selected sidebar item.
