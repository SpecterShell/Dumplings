    - Intralinks Designer now supports Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA) and Single Sign-On (SSO) using the OS primary account.
    - Resolved issue: After an Intralinks Designer update, a user encountered multiple problems because of a corrupted dictionary file. Changes were made to ensure that if a dictionary file becomes corrupted in the future, it will be automatically replaced.
    - Resolved issue: Filesplit users can select groups whose names contain special characters. A change was introduced in a previous release that prevents new groups from being created with special characters in their names; after this change, users were no longer able to select older groups if their names contained special characters. Users now can select both the old groups whose names may include special characters and new groups whose names cannot include special characters.

    - Intralinks Designer 现在支持使用操作系统主帐户的 Windows 集成身份验证 (WIA) 和单点登录 (SSO)。
    - 已解决的问题：Intralinks Designer 更新后，一位用户因字典文件损坏而遇到多个问题。我们已做出相应更改，确保将来如果字典文件损坏，系统会自动替换该文件。
    - 问题已解决：Filesplit 用户现在可以选择名称包含特殊字符的组。之前的版本引入了一项更改，禁止创建新的名称中包含特殊字符的组；更改后，用户将无法选择名称包含特殊字符的旧组。现在，用户可以选择名称可能包含特殊字符的旧组，也可以选择名称不包含特殊字符的新组。
