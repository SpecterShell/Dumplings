    🔧 other changes
    - fast again! ed6a8d5a
      - replaced the connection:close band-aid added in v1.20.4 with a proper fix that doesn't make things slower behind reverseproxies
      - I've tried everything I can think of (with nginx as reverseproxy) and can't notice any difference in behavior, but please let me know if this breaks anything for you 🙏

    - syntax highlighter: added languages nasm + nix, removed autohotkey + cmake b20d3259
    🌠 fun facts
    - http/1.1 still tends to be faster than http/2 and http/3 for large transfers which is the main reason copyparty hasn't made the change
      - eh, not really a fun fact I suppose ┐( ´ w `)┌
