    - #1298 add Hungarian translation (thx @sonacl!) eefb181b f37c3b96
    - #1299 chown now accepts 4-digit values (thx @new-sashok724!) 5a7504fd
    🩹 bugfixes
    - audioplayer skip-silence:
      - #1303 clamp ffwd to safe values (thx @icxes!) f5e70c7f
      - fix crash on folderchange f1a433a6
    🔧 other changes
    - due to legal reasons, the docker-images and bootable flashdrive are now unable to create thumbnails of HEVC/h265 videos and heif/heic images 1bec91d1
      - this primarily means photos/videos taken with iphones (and maybe some samsung phones)
      - on the bright side, this has made the docker-images much smaller; ac is now half the size it used to be, and iv / dj are each 97 MiB smaller
    🌠 fun facts
    - if you wanna see your car doing its best impression of a frictionless spherical cow, I can warmly (heh) recommend the icy snowcoated countryroads of viken this weekend
      - goes oddly well with sakuraburst - deconstructing nature
