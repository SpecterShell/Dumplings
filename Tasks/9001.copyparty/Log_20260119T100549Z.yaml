      - #255 newly uploaded files d9255538
    - new option vol-nospawn (volflag nospawn) to not automatically create the volume's folder on the server's HDD if it doesn't exist

    - the unlistc* volflags could not be specified for single-file volumes 26648911
    - the defensive renaming of uploaded readmes/logues would assume the default filenames, not considering the recently added option to customize these names c17c3be0
    - #1191 the ipu option can once again be used to reject connections from certain IP-ranges caf831fc
      - this was a regression in v1.19.21 causing the server to crash on startup if such a config was attempted

    - api: trying to ?ls nested virtual folders could return an error
    - ui/ux:
      - #1179 improve errormessage if audio transcoding fails 7357d46f
      - ensure a trailing slash when viewing a folder with the h permission; good for relative links in html-files

      - #1200 add html classes to make custom styling easier c46cd7f5

    - docs:
      - mention in the readme that uploading files from a deeply nested folder using a webbrowser on Windows can fail because browsers don't handle the max-pathlen limitation of Windows optimally (not a copyparty-specific issue, but still hits us)
    🌠 fun facts
    - n/a; no fun has been had since v1.20.0
      - (that's a lie btw, sniffing the airwaves is pretty darn fun 😁)
