    🩹 bugfixes
    - #1227 dillo was not able to login because dillo is more standards-compliant than every other browser (nice)
    - a web-scraper which got banned for making malicious requests could remain banned for one request longer than intended (wait why did I fix this) ba67b279463530742cd7f1f1adcb738e66dad8aa
