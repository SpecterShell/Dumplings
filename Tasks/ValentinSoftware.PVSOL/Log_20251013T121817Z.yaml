    The following new features and changes are included:
    - Calculation of annual cash flow in combination with taxes and loans revised.
    - If a loan is used in the financial analysis, the results now also include the “Accrued Cash Flow (Cash Balance) minus pending loans” diagram.
    - The “Energy cost trend” diagram can now be selected or deselected for the project report.
    - The climate data from PVGIS has been updated to SARAH3.
    - Revised calculation of direct own use of PV energy for DC intermediate circuit-coupled battery systems with time-controlled charging from the grid.
    - When planning with a DC intermediate circuit-coupled battery system with time-controlled charging and the energy at the inverter input is less than the charge of the DC storage, the Sankey diagram is no longer displayed in the results. This can occur if the DC storage is also charged from the grid.
    The following bugs have been fixed:
    - Financial Analysis:
      - In some cases, a heat pump was included in the calculation of savings, even though the system type did not include a heat pump.
      - In some cases, the charging of the electric car from the battery was not taken into account in the calculation of savings.
      - Error when loading the already simulated feed-in tariff in the first year when using DC battery systems and the Solar Peak Act calculation.
    - Off-grid systems:
      - Error when opening project files.
      - When the simulation is aborted, only a simple message is displayed instead of the crash window.
    - Crash when opening the Results page if a project from the previous version is loaded in which the simulation results were saved.
    - Error in the display of data series from thermal systems when exporting to a *.csv file.
