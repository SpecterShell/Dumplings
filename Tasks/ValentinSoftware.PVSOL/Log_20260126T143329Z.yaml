    The following new features and changes are included:
    - New system type: “Grid-connected PV system with electrical appliances, thermal systems and battery systems”.
    - Multiple from-grid tariffs can now be selected and freely assigned to different consumers.
    - New compact project report with the most important simulation results.
    - New load profiles for air conditioning systems, working from home and retiree households.
    - In the consumption dialog, the load profiles from measured values are now displayed in groups.
    - When importing consumer load profiles with a leap year, the correct number of values is now also output.
    - Updated climate data based on Meteonorm 9 (2001–2020).
    - All result graphics can be added to the project report.
    - Project reports are now also available in Lithuanian.
    - Project data and results can be exported to a JSON file.
    - The financial analysis parameters dialog has been redesigned.
    - For time-controlled charging and discharging of battery systems, time periods extending beyond midnight can now also be entered.
    - When exporting the results to a CSV file, the formatting of the exported numbers has been standardized and is now without scientific notation.
    - In the circuit diagram, circuit symbols can now also be inserted in front of AC battery systems and electric vehicles (only if the vehicle does not have its own from-grid tariff).
    - When exporting plans, the type of plan is now appended to the file name.
    - With the introduction of the thermal systems plus battery system, it is no longer possible to select the “PV-optimized” heat pump operating mode.
    - Diagrams of the characteristic curves can no longer be added to the project report because this would make the project file too large.
    - It is currently not possible to generate climate data from your own monthly values.
    - The combination of time-controlled charging and DC generator-coupled battery systems is now prevented.
    - The license management client has been updated (improved stability).
    The following bugs have been fixed:
    - In the economic efficiency results, one year was missing from the cash flow table if the assessment period was longer than the remuneration period including solar peak compensation.
    - In some cases, the payback period was given as more than 100 years if it exceeded the observation period.
    - When opening the options dialog, the time step of the simulation was sometimes changed.
    - In some cases, the simulation (yield reduction due to shading) did not start if settings in the options were changed after a simulation was aborted.
    - Balance error in the simulation of time-controlled charging and DC-coupled battery systems.
    - In some cases, the simulation results were not displayed correctly after loading a project with solar peak compensation.
    - In some cases, it was no longer possible to load project files after updating the online database.
    - In some cases, the open-circuit voltage was too high after loading the project report several times.
    - Crash when loading projects from program version 2025 with solar peak law that were not simulated.
    - Partial crashes on the welcome page when the program was closed.
    - Crash when loading projects with battery systems or electric vehicles if there was more than one group and results were already available.
    - Partial crashes in the dialog for selecting load profiles.
    - Correction of the display of the discharge power of electric vehicles (factor 1000).
    - A payback period of “1 year and 12 months” is now displayed as “2 years”.
    - In off-grid projects, the battery system was not displayed correctly in the circuit diagram.
    - Crash on the project report page when there were errors (e.g., a bitmap that was too large) in the circuit diagram.
    - Crash in “New Project” when multiple battery system groups were used but the first group was not selected.
    - Problems displaying the design bar for very high power ratings and consumption.
    - Incorrect translations.
