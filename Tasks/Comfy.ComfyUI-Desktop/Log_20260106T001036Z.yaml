    AMD GPU Support
    - AMD Software: Adrenalin™ Edition ROCm 7.1.1 Preview driver is recommended for this release and supports the use of --use-pytorch-cross-attention flag. This support is expected to be merged into the mainline branch in an upcoming AMD Software: Adrenalin™ Edition release.
    - For Windows users only: 96GB Variable Graphics Memory setting may be unstable on AMD Ryzen™ AI Max+ systems. 64GB Variable Graphics Memory is the optimal configuration. An update to how AMD Variable Graphics Memory is managed in Windows is expected to fix this in an upcoming AMD Software: Adrenalin™ Edition release.
    - For users with AMD Ryzen™ AI 300 and 400 series systems with 32GB memory please use "--disable-pinned-memory" flag with 8GB AMD Variable Graphics Memory for optimal performance.
    - For users with AMD Ryzen™ AI 300 and 400 series systems with 24GB memory please use "--disable-pinned-memory" flag with 8GB AMD Variable Graphics Memory for optimal performance
