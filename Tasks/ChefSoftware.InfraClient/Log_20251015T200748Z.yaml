    Improvements
    - Chef Infra Client has improved performance when building large arrays of cookbooks. Thanks @dafyddcrosby! #15274
    - We updated knife-ec-backup to include cookbooks with a frozen status. Before, this led to Chef Infra Server upgrades that didn't include frozen cookbooks. #15217
    Resource updates
    - We fixed the ohai resource where a nil value could be assigned to the plug-in path in the reload action. #15229
    - We fixed a bug in the chocolatey_installer resource that always downloaded the installer from Choco and ignored the custom URL option. #15306
    - We updated the apt_repository resource with the following changes:
      - apt_repository now correctly handles an array of key URLs in the key property when signed_by is true (the default).
      - If you invoke apt_repository more than once with the same key URL, later instances of apt_repository now correctly import their keys. Before, only the first instance would have its key imported.
      - apt_repository can now handle GPG key imports on Debian version 13/Trixie.
      #15235
    Packaging
    - We aren't releasing an AIX package for this release.
    - We added a software bill of materials (SBOM) to all builds. #15317 #15319
    - We removed old .NET version 5 DLL files from the build. We now use .NET 8 and these files now come directly from the chef-powershell gem. #15190
    - We added Black Duck workflows to scan for security vulnerabilities. #15093
    Security
    - We updated the activesupport gem to address CVE-2023-22796. #15298
