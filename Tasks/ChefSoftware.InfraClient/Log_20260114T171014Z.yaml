    New features
    - Added the -a/--all-users flag to the knife user list command to display detailed user information, including email, display name, first name, and last name. (#15494)
    Improvements
    - The path property in resources is now read once and reused, avoiding repeated property‑handling overhead. This reduces unnecessary computation and speeds up resource processing. Thanks @dafyddcrosby! (#15485)
