    We’ve made Enpass even better with new easy migration options for all users and stronger security controls specifically for business users.
    What’s New
    Easier data migration with new import options
    Users can now easily import your saved passwords and accounts directly from:
    1. Dropbox
    2. ESET Password Manager
    3. Microsoft Authenticator
    For Business users
    Stronger PIN Requirements
    Your admin may now define stricter rules for PIN creation, reducing the risk of weak or guessable PINS. Update includes:
    - New PIN complexity requirements – Your admin can enforce PINs that include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for higher security.
    - Prevention of weak PINs – Your admin can now restrict the use of repetitive, sequential, or easily guessable PINs (like 1111, 1234, 2580) ensuring stronger protection.
    Bug Fixes for Business Users
    - Fixed issues where passwords outside the defined rule set were incorrectly flagged as violations.
    - Other minor bug fixes and improvements.
