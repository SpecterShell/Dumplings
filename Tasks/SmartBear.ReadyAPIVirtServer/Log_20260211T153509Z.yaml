    - Support for ReadyAPI version 3.65.0: Updated VirtServer to support ReadyAPI version 3.65.0, including type casting in Conditional Match responses. VirtServer 3.31.0 works best with ReadyAPI 3.65.0. For recommended VirtServer and ReadyAPI version pairings, see ReadyAPI-VirtServer Compatibility Matrix.
    - Spring Framework Annotation Resolution Improvement: Improved annotation detection in Spring Framework scenarios involving parameterized supertypes with unbounded generics. Previously, annotations on methods in generic superclasses or interfaces might not resolve correctly, which could affect authorization decisions when using Spring Security’s @EnableMethodSecurity. This improvement ensures consistent behavior for applications that rely on method-level security in these hierarchies.
    - Java 21 LTS: Updated the supported Java runtime to Java 21 LTS.
    - Parallel Request Handling (RIA-25726): Fixed an issue that caused HTTP 500 errors when performance tests sent two or more parallel requests to a ReadyAPI/VirtServer virtual service. Sequential requests worked correctly, but parallel requests triggered an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in the REST dispatch layer. This issue no longer occurs.
    - Java Runtime Requirement: VirtServer has been upgraded to Java 21 LTS. As of VirtServer CLI version 3.31, Java 21 LTS is the minimum required runtime to run the CLI JAR.
