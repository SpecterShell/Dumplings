    [FEATURES]
    - Compare multiple reports in your tenant with the new Report Similarity feature.
    - You can now see where hierarchies are used across reports.
    - Table relations: inspect all possible relationship paths connecting two tables.
    - Execute DAX queries against any semantic model, including models in Pro workspaces.
    - New suggestion: Review whether auto-detected relationships are actually required.
    - New suggestion: Remove artifacts used only in filters without a filter query and not activated by a bookmark.
    - New report best practice rule: avoid using implicit measures.
    - Added Notebooks export in Tenant Analysis.
    - Enhanced DAX duplicate detection, including treating: CALCULATE ( Expression ( [Column] ) ) as a duplicate of Expression ( [Column] ).
    - Added Excel export with all uses to the table context menu (suggested by Justin).
    - You can now provide the format string for the rule "Provide format string for "Date" columns."

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed missing quotes in DAX expressions when using Enhanced Text Search.
    - Best practice rules no longer run on ignored artifacts when using Partial Analysis (reported by AlwaysNewDepth5 in the feedback section).

    - Resolved visual error: cv_visual_display_name attribute missing (reported by Pascal).
    - Fixed DateTime API fallback failures during license activation.
    - False negative for a column in Power Query when creating a chain of references and removing the original column from the original table in a intermediary table (Reported by Carlos)
    - Circular reference for downstream semantic models using direct query in Limited Tenant Analysis

    [MISC]
    - Improved error handling for all context menu (right-click) actions.
    - Translations, annotations, data categories and descriptions are now preserved when restoring artifacts.
    - Added more actions to the Notebooks context menu.
    - New columns added to the DAX tab: lineageTag, displayFolder, and description (suggested by Nick in the feedback section).
    - Improved violator descriptions for several best practice rules.
    - Improved paginated report dependencies behavior in the UI
