    IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2.4 is out! This release includes the following improvements:
    - The uninstaller now works as expected and should no longer fail and report an error when uninstalling a patched version. [IJPL-35268]
    - The IDE no longer freezes during code completion, which was previously caused by recursive StubIndex calls leading to a deadlock. [IJPL-2989]
    - cURL command conversion in the HTTP Client no longer fails when using the -b or --cookie options. [IJPL-177565]
