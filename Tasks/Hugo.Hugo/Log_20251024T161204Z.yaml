    In v0.152.0 we tightened the source validation for file mounts. We always said that project mounts can mount with absolute file/directorynames, modules/themes are restricted to relative. In v0.152.0 we narrowed module/themes mounts to be local, which made the setup in the bug report listed below fail:
    [[module.mounts]]
    source = '../../node_modules/bootstrap'
    target = 'assets/vendor/bootstrap'
    One part of this is security. But the construct above is usually very odd (the project uses files in a theme/module, not the other way around) and not very portable. But the example above demonstrates a valid exception, that we now have added support for in a portable way. The above example now works as it did before v0.152.0, but going forward you can also write:
    [[module.mounts]]
    source = 'node_modules/bootstrap'
    target = 'assets/vendor/bootstrap'
    We now have the node_modules as a special case: For themes/modules we first check if the mounted source exists locally, if not we try relative to the project root.
