    This release is mostly motivated by some upstream security fixes:
    - Upgrade from Go 1.25.1 to Go 1.25.3 which comes with 10 security fixes.
    - Go's net/html package also has one security patch
    I, @bep, have inspected the above issues, and none of them seem to be relevant for Hugo, but we understand that many want to have a clean security report.
