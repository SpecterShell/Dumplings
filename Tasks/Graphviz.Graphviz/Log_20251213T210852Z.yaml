    Changed
    - When seeding random number generators with time(NULL), the result of getpid() is no longer also mixed in. Previously this was the case on non-Windows platforms, impeding reproducibility and portability.
    Fixed
    - In the CMake build system, when WITH_SMYRNA is AUTO or unset, Smyrna enabling depends on the presence of Pangocairo.
    - In the CMake build system, versions of dot with plugins built in are only linked against enabled plugins. #2795
