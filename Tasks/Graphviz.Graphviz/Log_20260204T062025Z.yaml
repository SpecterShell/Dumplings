    Changed
    - Support for HP-UX has been removed.
    Fixed
    - On MinGW, Smyrna consistently uses / as a path separator.
    - In the CMake build system, building a statically linked dot with the Quartz plugin enabled has been repaired.
    - The configuration files exported by the CMake build system have an additional install interface of include, adding to the existing include/graphviz. The effect of this is that code using these files to access Graphviz headers can now prefix their include paths, e.g. #include <graphviz/gvc.h> instead of #include <gvc.h>. #2798
    - The colorscheme attribute when applied to edge labels works once again. This was a regression in Graphviz 11.0.0. #2801
    - The dpi and resolution graph attributes are now constrained to a minimum value of 0.0. This was already stated in the documentation but not enforced by the code.
    - Compilation from source no longer fails on Solaris with symbol conflicts due to lock_t usage. #2802
    - When compiling Graphviz from source, _FILE_OFFSET_BITS is set consistently in all compilation jobs. #2803
