    Added
    - Added option neato -n3 for fit ends of edges to nodes' borders when edge trajectory is set. #2736
    - Orthogonal edges now support rounded corners via the radius edge attribute. When splines=ortho is set and an edge has radius > 0, corners are rendered as smooth arcs instead of sharp angles. The radius value controls the size of the corner arc. Default is 0 (square corners).
    Fixed
    - Some Undefined Behavior in sparse matrix calculations has been removed.
    - In the Autotools build system, when the PHP interpreter (php) is available but php-config is not, building the PHP bindings is no longer enabled. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.42.0. #2788
