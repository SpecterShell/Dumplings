    Changed
    - Internal timing operations now use clock() on all platforms (previously this was only used on Windows). This should result in more accurate timing in verbose informational messages.
    - Building Graphviz with expat < 2.2.8 is no longer supported on MinGW.
    Fixed
    - diffimg now notices failures when calling Ghostscript to convert PS images to PNG and exits instead of continuing.
    - dtstat no longer reads/writes out of bounds memory on platforms where sizeof(int) < sizeof(size_t). This was a regression in Graphviz 7.0.1.
    - Some incorrect variable types in the libcdt man page have been corrected.
    - gvgen no longer triggers Undefined Behavior when asked to generate a binary tree with depth ≥ 32 (e.g. gvgen -t32).
    - gvgen no longer triggers Undefined Behavior when asked to generate a hypercube with depth ≥ 32 (e.g. gvgen -h32).
    - A null pointer dereference in edge pair analysis within the circo algorithm has been fixed.
