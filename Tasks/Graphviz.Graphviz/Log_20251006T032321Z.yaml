    Changed
    - The pre-built macOS package for Autotools is now a .pkg file instead of a tarball of binaries. #2726, !4348
    - In the CMake build system, whether Ghostscript-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_GHOSTSCRIPT={AUTO|ON|OFF} option. #2735
    Fixed
    - Points generated as curves by the dot layout algorithm are once again placed correctly. This was a regression in Graphviz 14.0.0. #2734
