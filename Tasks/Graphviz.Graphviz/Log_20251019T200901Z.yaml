    Changed
    - Quartz plugin code paths to support older macOS and iOS versions have been restored. Their removal was a regression in Graphviz 13.0.0.
    - In the CMake build system, whether Quartz-dependent components are built or not can now be controlled by the -DWITH_QUARTZ={AUTO|ON|OFF} option.
    - dot_builtins, when compiled with the CMake build system, now supports the Quartz plugin if it is enabled at build time.
    Fixed
    - Memory corruption when using the Java bindings to render to a string has been corrected. This was a regression in Graphviz 2.49.0.
    - A minor typo in the gvpr(3) man page has been fixed.
    - Calling gvpr(â€¦, NULL) no longer causes null pointer dereferences.
