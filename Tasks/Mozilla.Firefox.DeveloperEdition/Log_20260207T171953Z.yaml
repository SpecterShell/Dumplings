    Web Platform
    - The initial empty document is now Web-compatible: if the first navigation of a browsing context goes to about:blank, it completes synchronously and is no longer replaced by a second parser-generated document.
    - Firefox now supports the Trusted Types API, which is primarily aimed at preventing cross-site scripting attacks.
    - Firefox now supports the CSS shape() function, which allows defining responsive free-form shapes in properties that take shapes like clip-path. It has some advantages over the path() function, as it utilizes standard CSS syntax, supports various CSS units, and enables the use of mathematical functions.
    - Firefox now supports the Sanitizer API, which provides new methods for HTML manipulation. The element.setHTML() method enables developers to insert HTML content similarly to element.innerHTML, but without the security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS). A complementary method, document.parseHTML(), is also available for parsing HTML safely.
    - The joint iteration proposal adds new Iterator.zip and Iterator.zipKeyed methods that allow zipping together underlying iterators into an iterator over values grouped by position, similar to zip in many other languages.
    - Firefox now supports the position-try-order property, which is part of CSS Anchor Positioning and allows changing the order in which position fallback options are tried.
    - Service worker support for WebGPU has been added, making it available in all worker contexts. Service workers allow WebGPU to run in the background, which is particularly useful for extensions and other pages that can meaningfully share resources across multiple tabs and time periods.
    - Firefox now supports the location.ancestorOrigins attribute.
