    New
    - When a website uses a file upload field (<input type=file>) without specifying what types of files it accepts, Firefox for Android will now offer additional options to make file uploads easier. Users will see choices to pick a file, take a photo, or record audio directly from their device.
    - For users of the English-language versions of Firefox in France, Germany, and Italy, the address bar will now show English-language suggestions for holidays and other important dates.
    - Starting with Firefox 145, Nightly and Beta builds (b6 and earlier) can now find previously visited pages using Semantic History Search, which lets users recall sites with natural-language and concept-based queries, all processed locally for privacy. (Learn more)
    - Firefox Labs is now available to all users, regardless of whether or not they choose to participate in studies or submit telemetry. That means we have more features in the hands of more people.
    - macOS users now have a dedicated GPU process by default. This includes WebGPU, WebGL, and Firefox's own WebRender. With this feature enabled, fatal errors in graphics code will no longer crash the browser, and will instead transparently restart the GPU process.
    - Firefox now natively supports fractional scaled displays on Linux(Wayland), making rendering more effective.
    Changed
    - Firefox removed support for Direct2D on Windows. If you still require Direct2D support, please use ESR 140.0 or higher.
    Developer
    - Unused custom properties are now hidden by default in the Rule view of the Inspector.
      This not only reduces clutter, but in some cases also speeds up the rendering of the inspector panel.
    - Firefox now supports sending a post-quantum (PQ) key share during the DTLS 1.3 handshake for WebRTC connections.
    - Firefox now supports compressed elliptic curve points in WebCrypto.
    - Firefox now supports the contrast-color() CSS function that takes a color value and returns a contrasting color. Note that the specification currently restricts the contrasting color to black or white. This limitation is expected to be removed in the future.
      (Learn more)
    - Starting with Firefox 146, added support for calling showPicker() on text-based <input> elements with an associated <datalist>, allowing programmatic display of autofill suggestions for users on Nightly builds or Beta builds (b6 and earlier).
    - The Skia graphics library has been updated to improve rendering performance and compatibility.
    - The @scope rule is now supported, allowing authors to restrict styling to a subtree of the DOM. This avoids having to write overly-specific selectors.
    - Introduced the text-decoration-inset property, which allows authors to adjust the start and end points of line decorations.
    Web Platform
    - Firefox now supports the legacy -webkit-fill-available keyword as a value for the CSS width and height properties, to improve rendering of content on the web that uses this keyword. This keyword is an alias for the recently standardized stretch keyword (which isn't shipping in Firefox yet).
