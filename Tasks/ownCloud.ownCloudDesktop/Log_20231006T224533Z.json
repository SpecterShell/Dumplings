If a user chooses to point all folders for Spaces outside that default sync root, and deletes the default sync root folder, it will now no longer be created.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10919 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11128\n- Bugfix - Update capabilites and other info after connect: #10978\n  We fixed a bug where server infos might have only been updated several minutes after the client connected to the server.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10978\n- Bugfix - Account activity and crash after an account was removed: #10990\n  We fixed a bug where an account performed actions after it was removed.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10990\n- Bugfix - Crash during application shutdown: #11016\n  We fixed a where the main instance was accessed after it was destroyed.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11016\n- Bugfix - Hide hidden folders again in the selective sync view: #11047\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11047\n- Bugfix - Fix check if a file is a placeholder: #11107\n  Previously, files with zero bytes in size were considered placeholders. This is not correct, and has been fixed by using the correct API to check for placeholders.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11107\n- Bugfix - Hydration state of file after a directory was replaced with a file: #11162\n  If a synced directory was replaced with a file on the server, we downloaded it instead of replacing the folder with a VirtualFile placeholder.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11162\n- Bugfix - Only syncronize after the server settings where refreshed: #11168\n  We fixed an issue where the sync was started on outdated server settings.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11168\n- Bugfix - Consitently use the same icon for folders: #11190\n  In 4.0 we introduced a new icon for sync connections. In some places however we continued to use the system provided icon for folders, this resulted in an inconsitent applicaiton look.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11190\n- Bugfix - Branding of folder status overlay: #11192\n  We fixed a bug where branded overlay icons for the display of the sync status where not used.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11192\n- Bugfix - Creation of folder on the server: #11232\n  We fixed an issue in the FolderSyncWizard when the user provided a path with multiple slashes (//folder).\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11232\n- Bugfix - Selective sync when not the remote root is synced: #11233\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11233\n- Change - Remove support for sidebar entries for non-vfs setups on Windows: #10788\n  For vfs setups, this is handled by Windows itself.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10788 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10910\n- Change - Remove support for client side system proxy credentials: #10866\n  We removed the support to query and store credentials for the system proxy.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10866\n- Change - Modernize systray menu: #10939\n  We had a closer look on the system tray and cleaned it up.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10939 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10949 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10999\n- Change - We removed the pre 2.9 credentials migration: #11081\n  Migrating credentials from a 2.8 or older client is no longer possible.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11081\n- Change - Remove libcloudproviders integration: #11148\n  Since its implementation in 2019 our support our for it was 'limited'. Additionally as far as we can tell it was not picked up by any major Linux distribution.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11148 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11157\n- Change - Disable context menu item to get a public link for a space: #11242\n  The context menu item \"Create and copy public link to clipboard\" didn't work correctly when used with Spaces: users were always redirected to the web frontend. This menu item is now disabled, waiting for a server-side changes.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11242 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11079\n- Enhancement - Store proxy password securely: #261\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/261\n- Enhancement - Windows VFS: Prevent rename to ignored file name: #8216\n  We now prevent ranems of virtual files to ignored file names. This basically resulted in a delte on the server and a local placeholder that pointed to a non existing file.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8216 https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/63\n- Enhancement - Change how all files deleted is handled: #8360\n  When the client detects that all files are deleted on either side of the sync, the client now aborts the sync and asks for a user decision. Afterwords a new sync is started.\n  Previously we blocked the current sync until the user responded which could lead to unwanted side effects.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8360\n- Enhancement - Port from QtSingleApplication to KDSingleApplication: #8432\n  Instead of relying on an old copy of QtSingleApplication we use https://github.com/KDAB/KDSingleApplication\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8432 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10754 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10758\n- Enhancement - Enable crash reporter in commandline client: #8991\n  While the crash reporter still requires a graphical user interface to work, this change nevertheless simplifies reporting crashes from the commandline client a lot.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8991\n- Enhancement - Make \"Show files versions...\" context menu action available: #10197\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10197\n- Enhancement - Log http request when it is send: #10313\n  We now log the http request when it is send, not when it is created. This will elable us to print more headers set by the platform and messaure the request time more accurately.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10313\n- Enhancement - Allow selective sync of spaces in folder wizard: #10596\n  When manually configuring the synchronization of spaces, we now show the selective sync page again to allow users to selectively disable the synchronization of remote directories.\n  This prevents the unnecessary synchronization of files until the user can use the account settings dialog to configure selective sync.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10596 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11044\n- Enhancement - Send a language header in all http requests: #10619\n  All http requests to the server will now contain the language for the client. This can be used by the server to localize responses like error messages.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10619 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11020\n- Enhancement - Help user fix problems on the last setup wizard page: #10680\n  When there are problems within the advanced configuration on the last setup wizard page, we no longer just show an error message but also \"unhide\" those settings to give the user a chance of fixing the problem.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10680 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11029\n- Enhancement - Display a progress spinner during the initial setup: #10751\n  We now display a progress spinner after the setup wizard, until the client is done setting the account up.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10751\n- Enhancement - Reduce how often file changes are handled: #10825\n  We no longer handle file changes every 1s but gather them for 10s and handle them then.\n  This should reduce the amount of unnecessary checksum computations and attempted syncs.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10825\n- Enhancement - Persist filter settings for Not Synced tab: #10928\n  We now store the filter settings in the Not Synced tab. So after a restart of the client, the filter will still be the same as the last time.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10884 https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10928\n- Enhancement - --cmd argument added to the GUI client: #10976\n  In 4.1 we added a --cmd argument to the AppImage to allow users to use the commandline client contained in the AppImage more easily.\n  The --cmd argument is now supported on all platforms to support consistency.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10976"
