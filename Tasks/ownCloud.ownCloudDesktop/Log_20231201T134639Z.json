If owncloud is installed to a non root directory we computed a wrong url for the app provider urls. This could trigger a connection validation in the client, which intern triggered a request to the app provider. Reulting in an endless loop rendering the client unusable.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11296\n- Bugfix - Fix crash on unhandled status code on rename check: #11379\n  We fixed a bug that caused the application to crash instead of just aborting the current sync.\n  https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11379"
