    - Mining-related readouts were changed. They do not include mining waste per unit of time, but include mining efficiency. Efficiency means how much of ore drained from asteroid is converted into yield. Amount of ore drained from asteroid per second/hour is exposed in tooltips. See #2694 for info on what caused the change.
