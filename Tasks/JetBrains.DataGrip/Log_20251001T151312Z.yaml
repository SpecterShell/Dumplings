    DataGrip is now free for non-commercial use
    We're excited to announce that DataGrip is free for non-commercial use starting October 1! We believe this change in our licensing model will benefit the developer community.
    If you're using DataGrip for non-commercial purposes, such as learning, hobby or open-source project development, or content creation, you can now do so for free.
    If you use DataGrip for commercial projects, nothing will change - our existing licensing remains in place. Our blog post has more about the change and an FAQ, including how to activate your free license.
