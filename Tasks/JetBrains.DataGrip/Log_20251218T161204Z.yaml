    Query consoles are back as the default workflow
    After careful consideration of your feedback, we have decided to revert the redesigned query console workflow that we announced in What's New in DataGrip 2025.3 and Release notes.
    Thank you for sharing your opinions, thoughts, and detailed insights into your everyday workflows. Your input is what guides us most when making decisions.
    For more information about this change and our plans for query files, refer to the Query Consoles Are Coming Back blog post.
