    💝 Improvements
    - Add support for using a custom shape ("Mesh") for static objects having the 3D physics behavior.
      - This allows your characters and other dynamic objects to collide exactly with the shape of a platform, background or any static 3D object.
      - By default, the model of the 3D model itself is used. You can choose to use another model if needed (useful in case of a very complex 3D model: you can make the collision happen on a simplified version).
      - The Physics engine was also upgraded to Jolt-Physics.js 0.39.0.
    - Improve the list of objects, in the new object dialog, with custom objects provided by extensions:
      - Extensions, behaviors and objects lists now follow the same layout,
      - Assets are suggested for most custom objects provided by extensions, so you can start from a ready-to-use, pre-designed object.
    - Add point attachment rotation and scale conditions/expressions for Spine (Thanks @ViktorVovk!)
    - Add action to change the image of Tiled Sprite objects (rhanks @malec-palec!)
    - Add support for per-project editor preferences via a gdevelop-settings.yaml file (thanks @malec-palec!):
      - This works on the desktop app, for local projects only. See the documentation here.
    - Display properties of objects/behaviors in the extension editor in a tree: this allows to easily visualize, group and move properties around. Browsing properties is faster and clearer.
    - Allow to change the size (bounds) of a Custom Object variant from the sidebar.
    🐛 Bug fixes
    - AI fixes:
      - Fix AI not able to make an object global
      - Fix AI not able to duplicate an object from another scene
      - Fix AI trying to wrongly replace some objects
      - Fix AI wrongly able to add a behavior on an incompatible object
      - Fix AI wrongly changing resources on objects
    - Fix rotated 2D+3D layers with no 3D objects not rendered properly
    - Add automatic retry when installing extension to avoid intermittent failures.
    - Fix a crash when reloading the game page after a hot-reload
    - Fix variable or property initial values wrongly rounded to 6 digits
    - Fix loading of resources not properly retried when a resource can't be loaded (for example: network error) (thanks @ViktorVovk!)
      - Typically, when resources are downloaded from a CDN, then sometimes, for various reasons, a request for a resource may fail. In such cases, it’s very useful to have retry for avoiding intermittent issues.
    - Fix arrow keys not working in the layer list. Also clear layer selection when an object is selected.
    - Fix object effect toggles not being applied at preview.
    - Fix private objects not appearing in the list from within the extension
    - Fix time scale not properly applied to custom objects
    🎨 Assets
    - Add a new free pack: Development essentials by Kenney
    🕹 Premium Game Templates
    - [Example] Updated AutoTile by VegeTato:
      - Added a new action Force autotile system to run or stop​, this action is used for specific cases, like creating tiles from events at the beginning of the scene.
      - Try the example here.
    🛠 Internal changes (for developers)
    - Refactor caching logic in semaphore.yml to not fail with PR from forks
    - Ensure libGD.js can be downloaded when built for a branch
    - Rename French action and condition internal names to English
    - Expand operations that can be done on events by AI
