    💝 Improvements
    - Add basic support for skyboxes in 3D games: a new 3D effect called "Skybox" is available on layers. Once added, you can set up the 6 images to be displayed by the skybox.
      The skybox is not yet visible in the editor itself. Note that the future 3D editor will allow you to see the skybox in real time when editing the game.
