    💝 Improvements
    - Allow to switch the AI mode mid-conversation between "Ask" and "Build":
      - AI is in chat mode by default now if a project is opened, allowing to discuss with the AI before implementing anything,
      - The AI mode can be toggled between Chat (Ask) or Agent (Build) during a conversation, so you can first plan changes in mode Chat, then ask the AI to do it for you in mode Agent
      - The message when running out of AI credits is now clearer
    - Allow to maximize editor window on macOS by double clicking on the titlebar (thanks @ViktorVovk!)
    - Keep the chosen tool in the 3D editor even when selection changes
    - Advanced properties in the object editor dialogs are now collapsed
    - Improve the extension buttons to allow to submit an update to an extension
