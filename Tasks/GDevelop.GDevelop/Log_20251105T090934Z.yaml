    💝 Improvements
    - All the starters are now listed in their own section in the Create Project Dialog, to kick-start your game easily. Dozens of new starter games are available for all game genres.

    - The Create page and the "Create new game" dialog are now displaying the AI prompt input: this allows to get started and prototype games quickly, by letting the AI chose a starter game for you and adapt it to your request.
      - This input can be dismissed if not needed.
    - The AI Chat has been improved: it can now inspect your opened project events, objects, behaviors, extensions... It also has a better access to GDevelop documentation, improving its suggestions.
    - Multiple UX improvements for the AI:
      - The tooltips now explain if an extension must be installed or not,
      - The mode and prompt are now saved when re-opening the panel,
      - The panel is now always on the right when a project is open, or in the center otherwise.
    - UI improvement for courses:
      - Add a button to copy code blocks to clipboard in the Javascript Course.
    - Add hints on the web-app that local save is available in the desktop app
    🐛 Bug fixes
    - Multiple AI fixes:
      - correctly clear & load requests and history when logging in/out.
