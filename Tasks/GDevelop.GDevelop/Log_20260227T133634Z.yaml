    💝 Improvements
    - Add support for For Each events ordered by an expression, with an optional limit. For advanced use cases where it's important to run events on each instance of an object with an ordering, an expression can be written and will be evaluated for each instance separately. The For Each will then execute for each instance in the order of the results.
      - It's possible to change the direction (ascending or descending)
      - It's also possible to give a limit (for example, 1 will allow to pick just the instance with the highest/lowest value for the expression).
      - Examples are provided in the UI for common use cases (maximum value of a variable, health points, ammo, distance to another object...)
      In the following example, the 3 monsters that are the closest to the player will blink:
    - Improved UI:
      - Updated interface for the Anchor behavior with more intuitive buttons to choose horizontal and vertical anchoring.
      - Display a more compact search bar in scene editor panels
    - Improve robustness of events generation and asset search
    🐛 Bug fixes
    - Fix new group name to ensure no usage of forbidden characters
    - Fix tileset scrollbar area changing selection
    - Fix keyboard shortcuts (copy/cut/paste/delete/undo/redo) not working when editing variables
    - Fix properties sometimes missing or duplicated when grouped in columns
    - Fix UI for instance variables:
      - Removed the + button that was wrongly shown to add an instance variable (instance variables can only "override" the values of the variables defined in the object)
      - Fix paste/delete a child of structure/array of a variable that is re-defined in instances variables. Previously it was not possible to paste a variable as a child of a instance variable that was a structure/array. This is now possible (and fully supported - you can't add new variables at the "root", but items inside structures/arrays can be changed).
    - Fix property group wrongly set when dragging a folder to the root
    - Fix opening the 3D editor not working after launching a preview first on the web
    - Fix missing information related to center/origin of an object when created by the AI
    - Fix being able to rename a layer with shortcut
    - Fix 3D Physics engine misbehaving when density is set to 0
    🛠 Internal changes (for developers)
    - Update cordova config for new xcode/ios versions
    - Experimental menu options to allow importing asset pack files (GDO)
