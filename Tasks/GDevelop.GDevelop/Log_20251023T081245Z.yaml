    üíù Improvements
    - Add new course "Introduction to Javascript in GDevelop"
      - It will be made available in the next few days, as a stand-alone course and also available in the Indie Kickstarter Studio Bundle.
      - This is for users looking to learn JavaScript basics, implement complex patterns in their games, and learn how to manipulate GDevelop objects through JavaScript.
    - AI Agent improvements:
      - Improve Layers and Camera documentation, so the agent can more reliably modify layer properties,
      - Improve the AI to allow the agent to modify (or add or remove) object groups in scenes,
      - allow using "up" and "down" arrows to navigate through chat history in the AI agent & chat.
    - Improve previews on the web-app:
      - Support for hot-reloading (like on the desktop app),
      - Huge speed-up (no more file uploads, everything is done locally on the device storage),
      - Fix for Safari/Firefox not opening the preview window.
    üêõ Bug fixes
    - Fix Tilemaps layers visibility not being taken into account in the game
    - Fix default value of "String with options" wrongly reset in the extension editor
    - Fix .fnt loading for files generated by some tools
      - A new "header" has been added in every .fnt generated with the common BitmapFont generator at http://snowb.org/. They will now be properly loaded.
    - Fix leaderboard entry rate limiting: this enforces a limit of 12 successful saves per minute globally and 6 per minute per leaderboard.
      This is more than enough for the very large majority of games. This will avoid issues when sending too many scores because of a mistake or wrong game design.
