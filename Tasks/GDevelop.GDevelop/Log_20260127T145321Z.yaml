    💝 Improvements
    - The AI panel now allows to rollback your (cloud) project to a previous version. When the AI starts or finishes working, the project is now automatically saved and can be restored in a click. This is perfect for experimenting, trying new approaches or just building without losing your changes.
      When you restore your project, a new conversation is "forked" from the existing one, allowing you to continue building exactly at the time you restored the project and the AI chat.
      Remember that you can also restore your Cloud projects manually from any save using the project history panel.
    - More AI improvements:
      - Resources (for example, audio files) are now automatically imported when needed by events, and shown in the chat,
      - Robustifed AI asset search and handling of layers
    - The editor mode (2D/3D) is now saved per scene, so it can be restored when the game is reopened
    - Add a button to reset properties to their default values in the properties panel.
    - Display the new, upgraded subscription screen for users with or without a subscription.
    - Allow extensions to give choices between a set of numbers.
    - Change default scene background color to a less dull color.
    - The Asset Store now has ready-to-use assets for Bitmap Text objects.
