    üíæ Save States: introducing ready-to-use, flexible "Save & Load" actions
    The new "Save State" actions allow to save & load an entire game - or some part of it - using only a few actions.
    By default, the save and load actions will save the full state of your game at any time ‚Äî including all objects, variables, sounds, effects, and more. Saves can either be handled by GDevelop (which will save it on the device internal storage using the name you specify) or stored in a variable, giving you full control on where you store the content of this variable.

    The Save State page of the documentation describes all the features of this new feature, including:
    - Adding the "Save configuration" behavior to your objects to exclude some objects from the saves (typically, interface or visual controls should all be excluded to avoid them being moved when reloading a save)
    - Excluding variables from being saved/loaded.
    - Saving/loading from a variable.
    - Using "profiles" to tag objects (or variables, or game/scene data) and only save/restore these.
    üëâ This new example shows how to use the actions.

    The "Save & Load" actions are useful to do quick saves, long-term saves (for example, when a level is completed) or easily implement checkpoints (for example, save enemies/coins and restore them if the player dies and restart from the last checkpoint).
    ‚ö†Ô∏è While it will work in most cases, there are still a few limitations, notably saving of custom objects, and some objects/behaviors could have edges cases when restored from a save. The extension is tagged as Experimental while we gather feedback and improve it.
    üíù Improvements
    - Add "Pick Nearest" and "Rotate toward object" actions.
    - UI improvements:
      - Automatically scroll down the AI Panel when the AI is working
      - Automatically close the object editor dialog when editing a variant.
      - Save the selected layer in each scene so it is persisted across sessions (thanks @Digvijay-x1!)
      - Save grid settings in variant editors
    - Display both values and labels in selector properties
    - Add a grace distance to Destroy Outside behavior to avoid deleting objects if they are never seen but near the camera
    - Improved GDevelop documentation:
      - Core features are now grouped by category, like extensions.
      - Add collapsible blocks describing parameters of actions/conditions in the documentation.
