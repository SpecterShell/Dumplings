    What's new
    - Write Robustness:
      - Introduce WriteProgressWatchdog to monitor write progress and detect stalls
      - Implement recovery strategies for async I/O including queue depth reduction
        and sync fallback mechanisms
      - Standardize timeout handling for pending writes across all platforms
      - Add 5-minute emergency timeout as fallback for stalled operations
    - Performance:
      - Enhance recovery event handling and monitoring diagnostics
      - Capture SHA256 hash values in performance profiles for verification diagnostics
    - Image Handling:
      - Add support for parsing .gz files to extract uncompressed size information
      - Improve handling for files larger than 4GB
    - Disk Formatting:
      - Fix FAT32 formatting for large drives (>8GB)
      - Improve root directory handling based on sectors per cluster
    - Bug Fixes:
      - Fix external tools (runuser, xdg-open) failing in AppImage due to
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH conflicts causing PAM module loading errors
      - Improve thread safety for download cancellation
      - Enhance error handling for timeout conditions
      - Use Pathlib to generate file:// URIs in local JSON helper script
      - Use XDG-compliant canberra-gtk-play and PipeWire for audio notifications
        on Linux, fixing beep on Raspberry Pi OS which no longer ships PulseAudio control by default
    - Accessibility:
      - Bypass confirmation dialog timer when screen reader is active
    - Build:
      - Refactor Qt build scripts for improved POSIX compliance and consistency
