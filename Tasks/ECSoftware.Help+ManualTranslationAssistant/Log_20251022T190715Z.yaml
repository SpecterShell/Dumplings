    We are glad to announce the immediate availability of Help+Manual 10.0.2 and Translation Assistant 10.0.2!
    Help+Manual 10.0.2 Changes
    - Publishing Tasks: in dark mode, publishing multiple task entries created an error.
    - Insert Snippet dialog: mouse wheel support did not scroll the listbox of snippet topics.
    - The syntax editor always converted tabs to spaces. Syntax editors are used for XML topic source code and for HTML code in various dialogs.
    - German UI: visual glitches in Insert Link dialog and bullet list selection fixed.
    - Additional symbols implemented in Customize List Style dialog.
    - Config > Common > Text Variables: spacing of variables grid was larger than normal.
    Translation Assistant 10.0.2 Changes
    - Side selection in session window did not work on a single mouse click: a single click on any tree column must activate this side.
    - Copying (new) topic sub-folders from one project to another had a small bug: the resulting topics were copied but not correctly listed under this folder in Help+Manual. Instead, the topic files were listed separately.
    - Dialogs updated to match Help+Manual 10.0.2 (Customize List Style, Insert Snippet, etc.)
    All updates are available from our download page.
