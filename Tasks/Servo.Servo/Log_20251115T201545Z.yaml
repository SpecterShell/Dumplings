    v0.0.2
    This release is equivalent to nightly 2025-11-14, with some additional manual testing of the release artifacts.
    For our first release, the version number received a lot of attention. We are still establishing our release workflow, and this will be reflected in the version numbering scheme once the initial issues have been ironed out. See also our v0.0.1 release blogpost
    Trying out the Servo Tech demo
    MacOS
    The macOS releases are not signed yet, so you will need to follow the troubleshooting guide in order to run the Servo Tech Demo binary on your Mac.
    Linux
    If you see an error loading shared libraries when starting servo on Linux, please refer to the troubleshooting guide.
    HarmonyOS
    Please note that the servo-aarch64-linux-ohos.hap attached here is signed for OpenHarmony, not HarmonyOS.
    For HarmonyOS self-signing is currently required - You can download the servo-aarch64-linux-ohos.so shared library
    and use DevEco Studio to follow the instructions in the ArkTS Servo Demo repository
    What's Changed
