    v0.0.3
    Servo 0.0.3 is a comparatively smaller release, since we synchronized our release cut-off with the monthly November blog post, meaning that 0.0.3 contains only about 2 weeks worth of changes.
    Trying out the Servo Tech demo
    MacOS
    The macOS releases are not signed yet, so you will need to follow the troubleshooting guide in order to run the Servo Tech Demo binary on your Mac.
    Linux
    If you see an error loading shared libraries when starting servo on Linux, please refer to the troubleshooting guide.
    HarmonyOS
    Please note that the servo-aarch64-linux-ohos.hap attached here is signed for OpenHarmony, not HarmonyOS.
    For HarmonyOS self-signing is currently required - You can download the servo-aarch64-linux-ohos.so shared library
    and use DevEco Studio to follow the instructions in the ArkTS Servo Demo repository
    What's Changed
    Please check out our November blog post to get a curated overview over the recent changes (although some of them will have already been present in 0.0.2).
